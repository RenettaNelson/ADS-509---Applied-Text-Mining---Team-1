On the Bay/Mariner with a 5 minute walk to the ocean!  Always improving, changing, & renovating. One thing that is consistent - Heather Lawlor. There’s no surprise that most of the staff is friendly, professional, and hardworking, the ones which shine the brightest must have been hired by Heather or someone with Heather’s stellar qualities of customer service.  Just to mention a few, Manjoladuwa, Madelyn, Trey, Rachel, Esther, & Lily!  The newly revised housekeeping team is fantastic.

And Tristan saw that we were only staying one night, and he gave us a wonderfully bigger room!  It was my wife and me, and our 2 young adult sons so the room was perfect. The biggest drawback was that we were only staying 1 night!  We took a short walk to Mission Beach and then returned to sit on cabana bed by the water. We got dinner to go at Dockside where the world’s best bartender, Adam works. One bit of advice but won’t change my', 'Donate was very helpful in booking the right room for my family at the resort for our stay in August!

A HUGE shout out to our reservation agent - Diante Ashby. He has helped us 2 years in a row - and he is a big reason we will be coming back next summer as well.

Blue Sea charged $28, and I thought that was high.  The front desk was asked about this and the manager came up.  He told us that the corporation that owns the Wayfarer set the fee.  He said that they are a business.  True.  Although there are a number of places in Pacific Beach that do not charge a parking fee, or lower than the Wayfarer.

I might pay half of what they charged (almost $400 per night incl. taxes and fees) if it were quiet, which it isn't. The space is tiny with no storage/closet or safe and both the windows towards 6th street and the door towards the hallway are poorly isolated. You can hear people talking the hallway as if they were in your room and your bed frame vibrates when muscle cars or party bicycles drive by outside. And it is near a party location, so expect this until 3am in the morning on weekends and 1am during the week.

I’ve never had a hotel charge me for damaged towels before. They were so cheap and can easily be washed with bleach or replaced for way less than $110.

The rooms are literally on the street and there is zero noise reduction, you may as well put a sleeping bag on the sidewalk.  Dogs, sirens, loud cars, you can even hear every word and detail of conversation as pedestrians walk by (and drunk people later in the early morning).

They also have no staff onsite, and no manager to speak to - the best you will get is that “a manager will contact you within 24-72 hours” from the out of country call center.', 'Overall it was great stay.   The building is an old hotel that converted to a hostel that Sonder converted back into individual rooms. This particular room is on the corner of two major streets so there is a ton of traffic noise during the day and into the night. Saturday nights are the worst for noise because of both traffic and people who headed into the Gaslamp area. The noise didn’t bother me, but if you live in suburbia and are not used to noise at night then this is not the best room for you.  If you drive, parking is also an issue.   The proximity to the heart of the touristy areas is fantastic and the neighborhood is 100% walkable.  Currently, San Diego has a massive homeless issue, and while I personally never felt unsafe, some people might have a different experience.', 'Very easy check in; comfortable room, beautiful bathroom with lovely shampoo conditioner and body wash.

Place to sleep, bathroom for the four of us, mini fridge, microwave, and a really cool rooftop to spend mornings or late evenings.  The noise nearby was kind of an issue each morning, as it did seem that trash collection came around 5am every weekday. There was also some yelling and stuff happening around the hotel that was no fault of the hotel, but something to be aware of!  The hotel provided earplugs to counteract the construction being done nearby which was super thoughtful, and the staff were super polite when present! :)']"

The idea of looking for housing and furnishing it, seemed daunting. So we decided to stay and we’re immediately back at our desks flowing. We retooled our businesses during Covid.

The rooms were clean and stocked with everything we needed, even for a one night stay!

Check-in was relatively straightforward and friendly. As a residence inn, there's not much more than a lobby, small outdoor pool, small gym, and a bunch of rooms.

For example, we asked them to make up the sofa bed in our room, and they just told me to look in the closet where the sheets are located and we had to basically do it ourselves.  NO idea if the actual blankets are cleaned after every guest stay).  And when we asked to extend our stay by 3 hours or so in a room (we had a late flight, and we had already checked out of our original room), they asked us to pay $100 just to give us a dirty room to stay in.  Our original room was already cleaned so they couldn't have us stay there so a dirty room was given"", 'We came into town for a wedding.

The spaces are too small, and some don't allow the drive or passenger the room to get out.

So if it's open and you drive past it, you're stuck in front of a closed gate with no way to open it other than backing out.

We hope we can go back soon!', 'My wife, son and I stayed 6 days at the Villa Caribe on Ocean Beach in San Diego in August. We were very impressed to say rhe least.  We walked in using the  electronic code, no keys, yay! We looked around,  found the suite super clean.  then we see  a large bathroom, tub  with jets, extra towels and mint clean. The large bedroom had extra pillows and a newer bed. The kitchen was like new with a super modern coffee maker and blender as well as expensive silverware, cooking pans and dishware. This is a very classy place.  Outside a jacuzzi tub with color lighting for nightime soaking.  A very  nice landscaped area surrounds the place  and has a beautifull view looking out over the Ocean.

The location was fantastic It also had a parking lot right next door which was so convenient.', 'It was a great location. Easily accessible by old trolley bus or local transportation, takes less than 15 mins to reach convention center. Unit was equipped and it was right in the center of Gas lamp Quarter.
