# Classification of Hotel Reviews

## Team 1
## Team Members: Renetta Nelson, Jacqueline Urenda

## Objective
The objective of this project is to web scrape hotel review data from the Tripadvisor website to create a classification model based on the hotel review text data. Once the data is scraped, it will be converted into a pandas dataframe and will be cleaned and pre-processed. The dataset will then be trained using a classification model and will be evaluated for best modeling results. Classification categories that are being considered are a numerical rating basis such as 1-5, or a descriptive category such as “bad”, “decent”, “good” and "excellent”.
