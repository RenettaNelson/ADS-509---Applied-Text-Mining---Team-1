It's also worth mentioning that I am also a huge fan of the mini waffles, too!  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your wonderful experience here with us and for letting us know we were able to make your stay a memorable one! We hope to see you again soon!\n",
      "We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay, thank you for overlooking our industrial neighbors and giving us a fighting chance we love to hear it as we like to keep the place as charming as old times.

      "We are always disappointed to read when we do not exceed our guests’ expectations. We strive to educate our guests on TripAdvisor, our website, and on the phone so they have the right expectations about us. We have many repeat guests who continue to choose us because of what we are, a modest, family-owned and operated hotel, with great rates, many free amenities, NEVER ANY HIDDEN FEES, and an incredible staff! We are very proud of our hotel.   We are located in an industrial pocket and we’ll be the first to admit that our location is unusual for a hotel. When we first started in the 1940’s, Pacific Hwy had a long line of motels that greeted guests who used this road as the main thoroughfare from Los Angeles and Orange County to Mexico! Although the location is not something we can change, we do like to tell people that “we are nowhere but only minutes to everywhere!” The great thing about our location is that we are a quick walk to Historic Old Town and across the street from the Old Town Transit Center so you can get around town with ease if you want to leave your car behind. The trolley will quickly and easily get you to downtown’s Gaslamp District, Convention Center, Petco Park, the USS Midway Museum and Waterfront Village to name a few. We are less than 3 miles to Sea world, 3 miles to the airport, and less than 10 minutes to Balboa Park and the Zoo. We are also only a 5-minute drive to historic Liberty Station with many local shops, art galleries, and restaurants, including the Liberty Public Market.  We recently completed an extensive room remodel, with a more modern décor (pictures coming soon), and soon will be doing a major upgrade to our internet service.   We are not everyone’s “cup of tea;” however, we tend to rate highly with guests who are looking for clean rooms, good prices and a friendly staff that go out of their way to make our guests feel special.  Thank you all who choose US amongst the many choices you have in San Diego. We sincerely appreciate your business.\n",
      "Thank you for your feedback!  We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel again in the future!!\n",

      "Dear mineliea, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay. We appreciate your feedback and are sorry to hear the hotel failed to meet your expectations. It is my understanding that you requested to check out shortly after checking in. The front desk agreed to a full refund if you did in fact check out, however after many hours, you remained in the room. You decided to stay in the hotel despite all of the aforementioned issues. I can see that you created another TripAdvisor account, under the name of melenie2023, in order to write a second negative review of the hotel. I'm sorry you feel it's necessary to go to such lengths in order to be heard. A far more reasonable solution, would have been to check out with a full refund. We hope you will find satisfactory accommodations during your future endeavors. Kind regards\n",

      "Dear cnavar444028, Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay. We appreciate your feedback and are sorry to hear the hotel failed to meet your expectations. The room you stayed in is located in the terrace section of our property. None of those rooms are ADA accessible, hence the reason there is no ADA parking. The hotel is not pet friendly, however, guests ignore that policy from time to time. If we are aware that a guest has a pet (which is not a service animal), or a guest has a service animal that is not trained (certified service animals are), then we will ask the guest to checkout. It is not clear whether hotel staff was made aware of the barking dogs during your stay. We hope you give us another opportunity to serve you in the future. Perhaps you would enjoy a room in our newly renovated Pines building. Kind regards\n",

       " 'We are always disappointed to read when we do not exceed our guests’ expectations. We strive to educate our guests on TripAdvisor, our website, and on the phone so they have the right expectations about us. We have many repeat guests who continue to choose us because of what we are, a modest, family-owned and operated hotel, with great rates, many free amenities, NEVER ANY HIDDEN FEES, and an incredible staff! We are very proud of our hotel.   We are located in an industrial pocket and we’ll be the first to admit that our location is unusual for a hotel. When we first started in the 1940’s, Pacific Hwy had a long line of motels that greeted guests who used this road as the main thoroughfare from Los Angeles and Orange County to Mexico! Although the location is not something we can change, we do like to tell people that “we are nowhere but only minutes to everywhere!” The great thing about our location is that we are a quick walk to Historic Old Town and across the street from the Old Town Transit Center so you can get around town with ease if you want to leave your car behind. The trolley will quickly and easily get you to downtown’s Gaslamp District, Convention Center, Petco Park, the USS Midway Museum and Waterfront Village to name a few. We are less than 3 miles to Sea world, 3 miles to the airport, and less than 10 minutes to Balboa Park and the Zoo. We are also only a 5-minute drive to historic Liberty Station with many local shops, art galleries, and restaurants, including the Liberty Public Market.  We recently completed an extensive room remodel, with a more modern décor (pictures coming soon), and soon will be doing a major upgrade to our internet service.   We are not everyone’s “cup of tea;” however, we tend to rate highly with guests who are looking for clean rooms, good prices and a friendly staff that go out of their way to make our guests feel special.  Thank you all who choose US amongst the many choices you have in San Diego. We sincerely appreciate your business.',\n",
