      "Such a beautiful resort, very relaxing, and super fun! Perfect for my husbands and I anniversary trip!   Check in was super quick and easy thanks to Tristan!   Had amazing drinks at the restaurant bar and pool with Conner, Paul, and Chris!   We will be back!\n",
      "We visited here many times and sent three different sets of friends here as well. There is something very special and unique about this place. On the Bay/Mariner with a 5 minute walk to the ocean!  Always improving, changing, & renovating. One thing that is consistent - Heather Lawlor. There’s no surprise that most of the staff is friendly, professional, and hardworking, the ones which shine the brightest must have been hired by Heather or someone with Heather’s stellar qualities of customer service.  Just to mention a few, Manjoladuwa, Madelyn, Trey, Rachel, Esther, & Lily!  The newly revised housekeeping team is fantastic. Three people work together and replace and replenish and empty all towels, trash, water bottles, coffee, & shampoo etc., all in 10 minutes!   Dockside 1953\n",
      "This review is specific to my experience with Renee in the reservations department. She was so pleasant, so helpful, knowledgeable and frankly made the reservation process so easy, I wish more representatives were more like her. Thank you Renee! I can't wait for our stay!\n",
      "Professional, responsive and friendly staff from housekeeping, guest services and maintenance. Winsome, Prodlene and Daniel were especially helpful.   Great location for for beach, restaurants.   The property itself has a big pool and hot tub.   Would gladly come back.\n",
      "This was an awesome trip for our family of 5.  Everyone from Tristan at check in to Ben at check out were so friendly and welcoming. The gentleman at the concierge kindly provided our family with toy shovels for the beach- he was so nice! The private beach was perfect for spending sunny afternoons digging in the sand and splashing around. The cabanas were perfect when the little ones wanted to rest as well as for my husband and I for lounging and relaxing. The pool was gorgeous and clean. We enjoyed several meals at the Dockside restaurant, great food and scenic views, we loved the fire pits, heaters, great service and live music on Thursday.  We kept fueled on coffee and snacks from the airstream grab and go.  We took the 45 minute sunset Bahia Belle cruise on Friday night to\n",
      "Front desk (Tim) was especially helpful and courteous. Checked us in very quickly and made us feel very welcome—this was first time at this location— value much better than ANY beach rentals; close to the ocean but with the pool and private Mission Bay  access, this was much cleaner and safer.\n",
      "The lobby was nice and the people helping us check-in we're very helpful during our stay.   We stayed in the building across from the lobby with a bay view. It was noisy early mornings from trucks (I wasn't expecting a parking lot right out the window) leaf blower, etc. but pretty nice view.   I would give them a 1 star for cleanliness.  When we got off the elevator onto the 2nd floor the floor was covered with debris, wads of hair and garbage as far as we could see to the end of the hall. There were three housekeepers around a cart at the other end so I figured they had a busy weekend and we're going to be cleaning up the hallway. That was not the case, each time we went in the hall it looked the same. It got to the point that we were carrying wads of hair and debris on our\n",
      "I searched multiple apps for the best price. Called Bahia direct and talked to Diante. So glad I did! Got the best deal I’d seen so far, answered all my questions, and was super friendly.  Thx Diante!\n",
      "We had a great stay! The location is amazing and the staff are wonderful. Karina at the front desk really went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. I kinda goofed up choosing our room but Karina got us into a great room and coordinated it so we could get in as soon as possible. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "My family and I recently stayed at the Bahia for annual family vacation. We had an awesome time!! My kids had a great time at the pool and myself enjoyed the cabanas. I just want to thank Karina for her patience as there was some issues with our reservations. She was an angel! Everything ended up working out. My room was on the bay and I couldn’t have asked for more!! Thank you Bahia and Karina!!\n",
      "Loved my trip. Was treated with immense care! Could not recommend staying at this location more! The food is very well done, the drinks are great, and the dining experience on the roof level was spectacular!\n",
      "Wonderful hotel experience while attending a conference. We were offered the option to add on the lounge area. This is a great deal as we could go there for breakfast, snacks, and refreshments during the day.\n",
      "Beautiful, huge hotel with everything you could want right inside. The staff was great and there were a lot of touches to make the stay easy for guests, including a text number for any questions and digital check-in.  The location was fantastic - very close to the Convention Center, as well as tons of restaurants in Gaslamp;  and I had a gorgeous view of the ocean.\n",
      "The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Restaurants in around the property allows you to make all charges to the room if you wished for ease in the payment method. Located about 12 minutes from downtown and about 5 minutes from the Padres stadium. The roof top movies nightly was also a great a activity for the family or for couples.\n",
      "The room was great, the service was great! The only thing was the food at the conference was horrible, the breakfast on the 1st day was inedible. Lunch was cold as ice, no iced tea was served it was very sad. The 2nd day wasn't much better, sorry to say. it was very disappointing, especially since the venue is pretty cool, with a great location.\n",
      "I stayed at this property for a business trip end of May. My flight to San Diego was delayed and I was a bit irritated. Xan (front desk) checked me in and turned it around with her positive attitude. My room had a beautiful view of the port. My bed was very comfortable and I really enjoyed the property. Location was great!\n",
      "Arrived for a conference and was delighted by the location.  The room was comfortable, loved the pillows on my bed.  Used the workout room daily and had a great selection of workout equipment.  All staff were very friendly.\n",
      "Between the view, accommodations, and the location this hotel couldn't have been more perfect. I was very pleased with everything. I would highly recommend this location for business or pleasure. I didn't have time to check out the pool/gym accommodations so I can't specifically speak to those.\n",
      "Stayed here for a conference.   Hotel was SUPER.  Place is beautiful other than some weeds in the front lawn.  Rooms were very clean(16th floor) and big with great views.  Food was great and the staff on my floor was EXCEPTIONAL.   Went out of their way to get me a phone charger I forgot. My only negative was the TP.   Thin.   but then most hotels don't provide Charmin.\n",
      "I was in the hotel for 3 days. Everything is great. Service, people, bars and restaurant, pool, fitnessroom. They skybar on the 40th floor has an amazing view. I will stay in the Hyatt again when in San Diego.\n",
      "Great breakfast. Surprised by a great happy hour also. Nice staff in restaurant area... William, Mario, Felipe, Alvaro, and Ida all did a great job with breakfast. Also really appreciate Iniego, the Bellman.\n",
      "I really love this property. The common areas were extremely well kept & clean. The lobby is huge, and very beautiful. Thank you to the staff who I got to chat with during breakfast service, Erica & Iniego! Also Fran the supervisor was such a ray of sunshine! When I checked-in, my suite was perfect. It was a corner suite, a lot of space, super clean, and I love how new/modern the room felt. (see photos)  I didn't make it to happy hour but breakfast was good, and they made it felt safe during this COVID era (Thank you Felipe!). Phillip and Alan were so nice and helped with recommendations on how to fill my time, much appreciated!  I appreciated how the 4 elevators had a \"one person or family at a time, must wear masks at all times\" rule, and all guests were very respectful of\n",
      "Everyone who worked at the breakfast buffet was super friendly especially Ida and Alvoro! I got the omelets and they were delicious. Iniego was a great bellman. I would definitely come here again just for the friendly staff :) Everything was clean and organized, plus the lobby smells good\n",
      "Just spent 3 nights at the Embassy Suites San Diego.   The staff did everything possible to ensure that my stay was thoroughly enjoyable, and they were completely successful.  Quiet comfortable room, great breakfast, great location, great service.\n",
      "It’s been a great experience here at embassy suites. I have stayed in the hotel many times with family. Every stay was enjoyable.  Love the fresh made eggs at breakfast,  and IDA’s service was also on point.\n",
      "We had a great time! Donna Ortiz was there to help us our entire stay. We enjoyed her sunny disposition! Loved her!  She made all the difference.we had a reunion and she assisted with our buffet dinner and at breakfast daily.\n",
      "The service is great. They are always friendly and always attentive. They're always chatting up.   The breakfast food is good, they have a cook to order line. They also have a buffet line which is alright but overall, it's all good.\n",
      "Great hotel for families. The extra bedroom is great for putting kids to sleep and letting the parents have some downtime in the living room. Complimentary breakfast daily as well as 25 dollar resort credit and free drinks at night (2 per person) Ida at the breakfast buffet was amazing and provided amazing, above and beyond service.\n",
      "We enjoyed our stay. Our family vacation was filled with graduation and lots of family outings. Every morning at breakfast we were greeted by Ida who made us feel very welcomed to be guests at this hotel.\n",
      "The staff was ok. The hotel is clean and beautiful. Delicious breakfast with many options. Be aware, you will have to pay $60 per night for parking otherwise you'll have to find a place to park your car somewhere else. We requested a blanket, sheets, and a pillow but took the front desk 90 minutes and a second call to send them over.\n",
      "Family friendly resort, very close to Sea World.  The kids had a great time at the pool and enjoyed many of the resort games and amenities, including s'mores on the beach, live music, and table tennis/cornhole. The Cove restaurant was pretty good, but the pool food was just ok.  Like many places right now, they seem to be a little short staffed, causing the coffeehouse to be closed several times during our stay, and extended waits for seating at the other restaurants.   They do not offer complimentary water, coffee, or tea, and the resort prices are very high.  Recommend having a car to go get those things from a convenience or grocery store.  There is nothing in walking distance, and no hotel shuttle.   The property was very relaxing and is right next to a several mile\n",
      "My family and I had such a great stay at San Diego Mission Bay Resort! Everything was perfect from start to finish and the room service was always delivered so quickly! One of the best parts was the welcome that Aricelo at the front desk gave us! He was so humorous yet professional and set the tone for a great stay!!! He offered suggestions for things to do and let me know of all the fun activities available on site. Would definitely come back!\n",
      "It was an anniversary, nothing discussed with the reservationist was provided.  The price quoted was incorrect. The front desk clerk was very rude upon arrival. Very displeased. Guest were not pleased as well. The restaurant staff was very pleasant.  House keeping was very personable.\n",
      "A hidden Gem resort. Love the convenience of the location and the resort offers many services. Favorite was the spa and staff ! Especially the manager Teri she was so helpful, sweet and profoundly caring.  Parking was easy and room’s comfortable.\n",
      "I stayed here thinking the photos would represent what I was get if f which is why I was okay paying so much. It wasn’t as luxurious as the photos made it look. There was a day housekeeping didn’t happen. The rooms were not updated as it advertised. So expensive with hidden fees you don’t know about until check out\n",
      "We had an incredible time. Room is very comfortable, food very elegant. Staff friendly and helpful, atmosphere amazing. Lots of things to do. You really don’t have to leave the property if you don’t want to. Definitely coming back.\n",
      "We were treated like friends and it was so easy to get to any place from Mission Bay Resort (formerly the Hilton). Jeffrey was always out to greet us and Katie was full of suggestions on where to go (with a bonus coupon when we got there). The view of Fiesta Island and all rowers going by was an enjoyable extra treat. Evenings were relaxing with a fire and music. Don't miss out on a lovely spa treatment to start your day.\n",
      "You can hear an alarm clock go off in a different room, I was able to hear a child coughing that was in a different room in the middle of the night.  The rooms are not clean, dust throughout They charge fees for anything they can (they tried to charge me a pet fee even though there was no pet in my room) Without a car you would only have one restaurant to eat at\n",
      "This family friendly resort is central to all the activities around town! This is our third year in a row staying here! We love the garden suites to allow our littles to have a grassy play area. The pools are heated and there is a pool for littles. It is so convenient to the bay, Little Italy and downtown San Diego!\n",
      "Beautiful views of the Bay (for the water view rooms) amazing food, convenient location to everything San Diego has to offer- 15 minutes to La Jolla, 10 minutes to Balboa park, and downtown. The staff were all very friendly and helpful as well.\n",
      "We had our 2023 Company Retreat here at the Catamaran Resort and Spa. Our experience was wonderful. The property was breathtaking and so close to the water for some beach fun. Tre and Victoria were such great help with getting the rooms set up for our employees, and Debbie was an amazing help with getting our picnic event set up. the smores were such a hit with the kids and adults, Thank you, Kelly, from Bayside Bonfires! Overall the Catamaran Resort and Spa was a wonderful place to have our company retreat and I can't wait to have our next one there!\n",
      "This was our first time staying at this place, and it was absolutely phenomenal! From the moment we set foot on the property until the day we left.  Randy at the front desk was the best! Everyday we saw him, he treated us like we were the vip guests. Everyone we encountered, was amazing. The valet team was very kind and deserved every single tip they were given.  The location of this resort is wonderful, so close to sea world, which was where we went for my daughters birthday. Belmont park/ beach is very close by, went went there nearly everyday. The beach at the hotel is beautiful, despite their current renovating, it never disrupted our trip. The little pockets of fun at the resort, the pool, arcade, resultants, bar, coffee shop, everything was just amazing. 1000/10. We would\n",
      "Renée in reservations is amazing!!!  The customer service she provided was fantastic.  Super friendly and very helpful.  Very knowledgeable of the area.  We need more people like, Renée.  Thank you, Renée.\n",
      "Thank you Jackie for taking time to introduce my 8 yr old son and I to all the wonderful birds at the Catamaran Resort. It was amazing to listen to their sounds and words, to watch them interact with you, and witness firsthand how friendly and smart they are with your support. You are awesome and so are they! Thank you to the Catamaran for offering this experience!\n",
      "Would like to start by saying my first impression of the place was remarkable walking in the front doors and getting awesome service.   Randy at the front desk was the man. Had all the answers to my multiple questions after multiple trips up there.   Atmosphere is great, feels like you’ve got your own private beach. Rooms are cozy, the decor and the way this place is designed is awesome. Feels like you’re in a jungle. Birds, turtles, ducks, running water and fish all over the place. Super relaxing.  Just wanna throw it out there again that my satisfaction with this place started at the front desk. Good experience from there on. Thanks.\n",
      "Very disappointing…dated and dirty. The photos on the website are VERY misleading. I also found it inhumane that they keep caged birds in a high traffic area where they are harassed by staff and visitors. This hotel is in desperate need of a physical and ethical update.\n",
      "I just booked 3 nights for our 5th anniversary. We stayed here for our honeymoon, and wanted to book an impromptu trip to celebrate and also for my husbands birthday. I wasn’t expecting and miracles but Diante totally made it happen! He was excited for us and it really felt like he wanted to help us celebrate. If our stay is as great as he was, we will be over the moon! We can’t wait to come back and see the renovations!\n",
      "I had to make changes to my reservation, and I spoke with Renee, she was wonderful. Not only was she friendly, she listen to why I had to make changes to my reservation and offered suggestions on how to make my stay more pleasant.\n",
      "My husband and I spent 3 nights here at the end of May.   The staff at this hotel could not be better - everyone from the front desk to the coffee shop to the valet and the gentleman from maintenance that had to come up to our room.   Everyone in housekeeping was amazing.   When we couldn't get into our room early (we had traveled a long distance), the gentleman at the front desk  held for us a  room in the tower with great views.  I had forgotten my glasses when I went to the coffee shop and the lovely woman read the menu to me!  Everyone who works there is really lovely.  Now for the not so great.   There was construction all over the place.  We called multiple times prior to arrival to verify that this was not an issue.  Beware - it is.  There is noise and clutter all over\n",
      "In room safe is not working. Requested a room change but got pushed from guest service to security to front desk and all around. Got hung up on 2 times while waiting to speak with a supervisor.   To be fair, they did finally offer a room with a new safe which they said is likely working but the room did not have a fridge. And it was not ready. Unfortunately, they offered this after hours of waiting and just after I bought my groceries. I requested to wait for another alternative and was left without resolution and also no update.  They also said they had some policy that their housekeeping cannot clean the room 2 times in a day so cannot swap rooms unless there is a no show.   Other than that, soundproofing is poor and guests facing the carpark are disturbed by cars and pple\n",
      "To share the highlights, the grounds were impeccable, and the spa was fantastic. The marketplace was well stocked and convenient. I liked that my room was like a townhouse, with no one above me.  There was also a lot of opportunity for improvement. My room was spartan, with a piece of plywood underneath the mattress. I would suggest replacing that with a box spring. The flat screen tv with a multitude of channels was a boon, but the bathroom was claustrophobic, and I couldn't get the water for the bathtub to work. I would also suggest a modicum of maid service to tidy up. The air conditioning unit was old and extremely noisy.   In addition, there was a dearth of activities. There were no exercise classes offered, no one showed up for the rock painting class I signed up for. The\n",
      "We had an awesome time!! Resort was beautiful and very well kept. Staff were super friendly and helpful . Very “Island feel”. We spent most of our time on tbe grounds and it did not disappoint! Massage was awesome at the spa, we loved the heated pool and LOVED feeding the ducks, turtles and fish . Very relaxed and beautiful atmosphere. Room was very clean and comfy.\n",
      "Great for a family get away. Definitely get to the coffee shop, they make great vanilla lattes. Talk to the people doing the valet parking. the guy there has some great restaurant choices to eat off site.\n",
      "Great place to take photos and pretry relaxing. Drivers to your room is useful especially if you're lost. Great service and food. Barely can hear outside and neighboring rooms. Very large property, map was very confusing.\n",
      "The location is good and the public facilities are unique. The room renovations are too old, and beddings are not comfortable. The experience doesn’t quite meet my expectations given the price I spent.\n",
      "We stayed for 3 day didn’t like the and the bad was making cracking sound with each movement I had handicapped sign so can’t walk Mach I wanted a parking sit infront of the room but this time wasn’t the case\n",
      "Overall, the best thing about this place is the location which is why we chose to stay here to begin with. The rooms are nothing to write home about, although, we didn’t stay in one of the beach front suites and I would hope that based on their pricing they would be next level. I read a bunch of reviews before staying here  and I will say this- the staff is efficient and friendly, the only improvement would be that they could be a tad more helpful in the lobby as far as transportation recommendations and making sure you know how to find your room. I knocked the cleanliness because it is very clear that these rooms are not regularly deep cleaned, which they do tell you. I think that for the price of the room they could do with going back to daily turnover service. The property\n",
      "This place really was paradise because of the staff! We went with 57 other people, all families and had such a blast! Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of but Carlos went above and beyond. We had an issue that he immediately resolved and we were so grateful for it. Promote that guy! Will definitely be back soon. Hope to see him as a manager when we do :)\n",
      "At end of busy trip to U.S. from Scotland we really appreciated our last five days of relaxation.  We partook in sporting activities- kayaking, golf, crazy golf, quad cycling, table tennis as and when we felt like it and everything was available at times we wanted.  At other times we relaxed at the resort in beautiful surroundings.  The food at higher end restaurant was a little disappointing but otherwise five star review.\n",
      "I went for a business trip over the weekend and had an amazing time the food was amazing and the service was excellent. I was greeted with smiles and I was offered to be driven to my room since there was distance from the lobby\n",
      "Thanks you Stephanie and Gerry for a wonderful late dinning experience at Amuse. They were courteous, efficient and helpful with menu choices. The bar area was clean and well maintained. They were dressed appropriately to apparent uniform standards and well groomed in appearance.   Marriot Bonvoy # 378008999\n",
      "A decent hotel with clearly older rooms. The window of my room looked over the balcony of the neighboring room - which essentially meant that I had curtains all the time. Pretty bad to have to do this in San Diego. Room was also with thin walls; I could hear shower, toilets, etc. from neighboring rooms. Hallways had a stale/fouls smell that crept into the room in the first night.  Breakfast service, with an empty room, was quite slow; food was expensive and pretty average - so best avoided.  People were nice but I have been at much better Marriotts and was expecting more from such a highly rated one in San Diego.\n",
      "I am here for a work conference, decided to have lunch at the bar. Subrenia was wonderful. Great conversation and superb service. Food was good, beer was cold. Would highly recommend to others and coworkers.\n",
      "The hotel offers a very relaxing experience with its expansive circular entrance and open space lobby. However, the sleeper surprise was the breakfast. An efficiently managed operation w exceptional food - I had the buffet. Extra plus, a full meal for two was on the house as part of my Marriott status. Bravo!\n",
      "Though we had challenges with our AV, the staff did everything they could to make things right!  We had a very successful conference with much thanks to James, Joey, and Carlos!  Thank you all so much!\n",
      "Cindy at Starbucks cafe was amazing! Very polite and helpful! Gave me an itemized receipt to submit for company reimbursement! The coffee was prepared great and she was easy to talk with while working quickly!\n",
      "Cindy was great!  I needed an itemized receipt from 2 days prior and she had it for me the next day. She was helpful and polite. She greated us with a smile and was very friendly. I appreciate your welcoming nature and disposition.\n",
      "Book a vacation through Marriott vacations and they gave me and my 16 year old son. on a single bed had to pay $276 to upgrade to two doubles. They did not give us the concierge level and paid I paid a  ton of money to stay here. It’s a disgusting hotel that’s old and run down and there’s a literally bugs flying around the lobby.    Front desk lady was extremely rude telling me I booked it on Expedia not Marriott vacations. Apparently Marriott uses Expedia as a third-party.  The place is in need of major repairs. There is Siegel poop all over the pool, deck and seagulls in the pool. Totally disgusting.     I  will never stay here again awful Customer Service and awful accommodations so disappointed.   .terrible!\n",
      "Came to UTC to meet some friends and we had heard there was a new menu and new chef at Amuse.  While we were there enjoying the incredible food Chef Josh happened by. He stopped at our table and walked us all through his new menu.  He was very charming and excited about the food. We are excited to come back and finish our journey through all the options on the menu. Kudos to your team. Abi was very friendly and attentive as well and deserves recognition too.\n",
      "We had a great stay at the Marriott La Jolla. It was a great location. We also had a voucher for the breakfast Sunday morning. What a great breakfast and the coffee was delicious. We had a great waitress named Subrena and she was super helpful and kind.\n",
      "We had a quick 2.5 day trip to San Diego and needed a clean, budget friendly, safe location to stay.  This hit all the marks! The lady checking us in was super nice and explained the pools rules (wristbands required) and gave restaurant recommendations.  The property itself was beautiful with a resort like feel.  The room was spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable.  I got up and went walking along the marina each morning.  The location is a quick drive from downtown.  There are several restaurants within walking distance and definitely many good ones within a 10-15 minute drive.  I would stay here again for sure next time we were in town!\n",
      "We had a great week long stay at the Best Western Island Palms. We stayed in a marina view one bedroom king suite with a kitchen (no oven).  I called a week before our trip and Danny recommended the marina view room and said he would pick out a good room for us. We were very happy with the room. It was clean and modern enough (some signs of age but nothing too noticeable). I should note that I have very high standards for hotels. The separate bedroom was great since our toddler goes to bed early and naps during the day. The bathroom was separate from the bedroom which was also nice. The balcony was a good size and the view of the marina was great. We could also see the bay from our balcony. The hotel was quiet. We were never disturbed by noise.  Housekeeping stopped by once to\n",
      "Unfortunately for the price we paid we feel that the rooms need to be updated. Our room was not as clean as it should be and we actually had to call and ask for our sliding windows to be cleaned. The grounds were amazing, the service was amazing for the most part and the wedding for my kids went off without a hitch. We did have an issue with the slow service from one of the waitresses at the restaurant as well. She just wasn't pleasant either.\n",
      "Great room and property--staff was very helpful, room comfortable and quiet.  Appreciated the support given by checkin staff, and the cleaning staff.  Beds were comfortable, lots of pillows, and appreciated the gratis room fridge.\n",
      "Tennis courts need to be resurfaced, cleaned and new nets; the staff needs to make sure that the kitchen are well stocked with the basic items, such as coffee maker, bagged coffee grounds, basic cutting knife, kitchen towel, dish detergent.\n",
      "Great hotel overall. We only stayed there one night but it was very enjoyable. The location is fantastic. The room, while dated, was very clean and in good condition for the most part. The beds were very comfy! The room although it's showing it's age is still pretty nice and has an island like theme going for it. Honestly, I don't agree with most hotel beds but this one was great! I would definitely stay again!\n",
      "I’ve stayed at the best western Island Palms twice now within the last year. Great lodging, clean rooms, great views, and walking distance to many attractions/food/bars on Shelter Island. Staff were genuinely kind, helpful, and always made great recommendations for local food/drink/attraction locations. The experience at the hotel is always great and I look forward to visiting again soon.\n",
      "I had my door tag hung up for do no disturb for all 4 nights of my stay. Housekeeping entered my room twice. I reported it to the front desk after the first time it happened, but it happened again even though I complained about it. Front desk simply apologized, but obviously it was not enough to have that corrected.  Sprinkler system turns on at 11pm. If you have a room near the sprinkler system or must walk through their grass area, beware that you must enter your room before 11pm.m otherwise you have to walk through the sprinklers and get wet before returning to your room. There are certain rooms that there are not other ways of bypassing the grass areas.  My bathroom floor had a lot of debris. It looked like dust from construction or painting that peeled off thr wall. After\n",
      "Awesome stay! We had an upgraded room with a beautiful view of the Marina. Such a beautiful property with wonderful staff. Check-in was easy, plenty of parking and everything was easily accessible.  Special thanks to Tonya and Kyle who made this stay very enjoyable.\n",
      "We booked a King Suite with Marina View for a small family getaway. We were assigned a second floor corner room with partial view from the balcony. The carpet was filthy and turned my baby’s feet and the bottoms of her pajama pants fully black after walking on it for about 10min. Our express breakfast order was never taken. (The front desk offered a $50 voucher to use at the restaurant as a resolution. That covered less than half the cost for breakfast for two adults and a 14mos old baby. However, we were still grateful.) The flusher on one bathroom toilet was broken. The water would run after flushing and we would have to fix it by removing the top and jiggling the chain inside. The ceiling fan light was out. AND an almost 3 inches fat cockroach was hanging on the shower\n",
      "Booked this for our San Diego trip. The sink in our room smelled like rotten eggs. I'm very surprised the housekeeper/maid did not notice this when cleaning. The Aussie Bites available at breakfast were also beyond the Best By dates of 05.09 and 05.23. I did receive a general email \"We hope that you had a wonderful time and enjoyed our hospitality.\" etc. and it also mentioned if there were any problems to email John the owner. I sent an email and never heard back. Would also recommend cleaning the carpets as the dirt was more than visible on our socks. Other than these couple of things, the room was good and beds were comfortable. Super friendly staff in the breakfast area and front desk. Not a lot in the immediate area, but a 5 - 7 min. drive East or West and there is plenty of\n",
      "We stayed here for 3 nights during Spring break.  It's very close to Old Town San Diego.  Old Town in itself is a destination with lots of restaurants, shops and historical sites and museum.  The transit center for the trolleys are also nearby.    The Old Town Inn is right near the freeway exit but you don't hear it.  There's nothing else around as it's a commercial area - auto body shops, storage center.  But you can feel safe, there are government offices across the street.  It's better than staying in the bustle of Hotel Circle.  Too many people over there!  The staff at the Old Town Inn genuinely wants you to have a good stay.  You can see their smiles extending to their eyes.   Everyone is friendly and helpful.  It's very clean.  The person working the breakfast room is\n",
      "The hotel, lobby, and parking are all well-maintained and the employees super friendly.  Our room had 2 queen beds and was spacious. The shower pressure was nice and the toiletries smelled good. We were pleased with the continental breakfast, our two kids (6yo and 8yo) were very happy with the breakfast options.  While most other hotels have eliminated housekeeping during your stay, Old Town Inn still offered it daily.  The location was perfect for our needs. It's so funny to find this nice motel in the middle of such an industrial area.  For anyone with kids, this motel is 15 minutes from the Children's Hospital system of Urgent Care and the Children's Hospital emergency department, too. (Yes, we had *that* kind of vacation.)  We would happily stay here, again.\n",
      "Benjamin at the front desk was  attentive, welcoming, and helped us score a sweet upgrade! Overall the resort was great. the private beach and the hot tub were highlights. would definitely come back here!\n",
      "We always stay here when we are in San Diego.  It is quaint and nostalgic. It is well managed,  and the service people are friendly and very accommodating. We feel safe staying here. There is easy freeway access, and it is easy to get to all of San Diego.\n",
      "Excellent service! The rooms were wonderful the bed very comfortable pillows were great! The pool and patio are beautiful! Wonderful breakfast the next morning. Will definitely come back again! Are close to old town easy to get to.\n",
      "We stayed here for 3 nights. I have mixed thoughts about the place and if we return to San Diego I would rather stay by the water front area. The good things about the place were the amazing friendly staff, the well kept garden/pool area, comfortable bed, clean room, good shower. We did not like the location at all and ended up using Ubers to get about. The negatives for us were the strange smell in the room which we thought was dampness as you could not open any windows to air the room, and we felt the breakfast was poor quality. The coffee was not nice. We were also kept awake one night with loud television noise from the room next door until we eventually called reception at 3 am to sort it out. It was probably good value for money but we would rather spend more and stay in a\n",
      "Double Queen Room.  $100 Security Deposit was not noted on our confirmation.  Room was quiet and clean.  No perfume odors.  Great shower.  Excellent front desk service at check in and check out.   This location is a little ways from all the other hotels.  We felt safe and secure at Old Mission Inn.  Breakfast was the usual with good yogurt.\n",
      "Located on the edge of the city and next to Old Town, the Inn provided clean,comfortable accommodation of a good size. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast gave a good start to the day. Nearby Old Town provided a range of options to travel into the city including the hop on, hop off tourist tram which gave a great tour of the San Diego.\n",
      "PROS: good value, convenient parking, friendly staff, old fashioned motel-like feel, pool seems nice enough, Beds are comfortable and the shower is great.  Includes a more than decent breakfast - many options, much better than the \"continental\" breakfast it's billed as.  VERY convenient to go in any direction for all of the fun things to see throughout the many corners of San Diego (including the airport). Kitchenette is well equipped.  Suite offers two rooms, convenient for work. CONS: it's literally on the other side of the tracks, not within the fun, touristy old town area.  It's close enough to walk but it's not a pleasant walk.  The rooms are dark and dated, the water from our sink had a nasty aroma, towels are threadbare, Wifi was spotty.\n",
      "Great location in the middle of everything but quiet. Friendly staff who greeted upon every entry and exit, no issues or concerns with our stay. Nice to arrive in the midst of the weekend market for an instant activity. Also great to let us check in early when travel plans changed.\n",
      "Chris was the highlight of our entire trip. We were down for a wedding and with everything going wrong, Chris was the only nicest, friendliest and most curtious gentleman we have ever met in the entire city. He helped us with all of our questions, concerns and problems, and was efficient and professional. We would highly recommend dealing with him when staying at this hotel.\n",
      "Close to everything in little Italy. Older building so rooms are a little smaller but plenty of room for 3 suitcases and 2 people. Beds were big and comfy.  Room and bathroom were clean and well apportioned. Will definitely keep on the list when coming back to downtown San Diego. Service was great and Christian specifically was a amazing!  He was at the front desk during the mornings and was very informative and helpful with finding local things to do and getting tickets!\n",
      "Probably the best location in Downtown San Diego. Walking distance to everything exciting from signature restaurants, popular pubs, breweries and the infamous Farmers Market. This Boutique Hotel compliments the location with a very clean and comfortable ambience for a pleasant place to rest your head. From the front desk to house keeping was never disappointed. Bravo! Until next time San Diego!\n",
      "Wonderful stay, warm friendly staff from check in to check out. No problem travelling with my dog. Location perfect for eating and walking activities. Bed was super comfortable, room quiet. I was worried about parking, but hotel has loading zone to check in and unload/ load. Covered parking a few blocks away worked out well\n",
      "My stay at the Urban Boutique was Fantastic!! The Hotel was clean and  staff was friendly and very helpful.  We were central to some amazing restaurants, bars and coffee shops and 5 minute drive to Down Town. Definitely recommend next time you're in San Diego.\n",
      "I needed to book a place last minute and Christian answered the phone. He was incredibly kind and helpful and made me feel comfortable staying in a place I was unfamiliar with. He was able to answer all of my questions and was an all around nice person. His customer service along with the comfy, spacious room made my intro to San Diego a great one. I recommend this hotel as the location is perfect and their pet fee is very reasonable.\n",
      "it is a nice hotel and the people there are remarkable. Always helping and always with a smile. There is no room cleaning so bear this in mind if you re staying longer. I don t know the reason. The area is great and without homeless people taking drugs around as Inhad in other areas.\n",
      "I liked this hotel especially the wonderful service upon arrival. I was even allowed to check in earlier. The staff are great and always with a smile. The hotel is ok, no cleaning service though. The area is great with many restaurants and no homeless people which is an improvement compared to other downtown areas. I recommend\n",
      "Had the best stay at the Urban Boutique Hotel right in the heart of Little Italy. Check-in was flawless, and as an added bonus we got to our room  3 hours early. Chris, at the front desk, is a wonderful ambassador for San Diego - informative, funny, and took the time to help us, which made our time that much better. The King room was perfect, well laid out, spotless, quiet, and stylish. The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot. What more could you ask for? Would come back here in a heartbeat.\n",
      "My wife and I had our first trip without children in over 20 years, and had a wonderful time at the Pacific Terrace Hotel.  We stayed in one of the sunset suites, specifically the St. Croix suite, and it was amazing.  The room was very clean and even more spacious than the pictures show.  Our terrace was right over the pool with a direct view out to the ocean.  We saw some amazing sunsets from our terrace (see photos).  The whirlpool tub was huge, and felt good to soak in after a long day of site seeing.   The staff was beyond friendly, providing tips and recommendations on things to do and how to get around the city / public transportation, as well as places to eat.   The grounds were beautiful.  The pool area had numerous tables and chairs, lounge chairs and cabanas.  The\n",
      "A little “me time” after a 2 year pandemic! So relaxing and exactly what I needed. The service was impeccable from the front desk to the pool. Loved having breakfast poolside, the pancakes were delicious. Can’t wait to come back & take in the sun, sit on the balcony & dip in the pool. Thank you for making my stay absolutely wonderful!\n",
      "Stayed in one of their suites for two nights.  Found the staff, cleanliness, and location to be excellent, but found the room to be in need of updating and the mattress lacking for the price point.  Definitely has the boutique hotel feel and shows promise with the attentiveness and helpfulness of the staff.\n",
      "I have stayed at the Pacific Terrace solo & with my family close to 10 times and consistently have an amazing experience. The staff is fantastic - especially the manager Lloyd, who consistently goes above & beyond to make sure my East Coast Based family is well taken care of every time we visit (which is multiple times a year).  Location is great - short walk to everything you need (complimentary bikes for rent as well!) - including morning coffee/breakfast a short walk down the boardwalk. Yoga overlooking the ocean just a short walk away at Law Street Park, easy access to surfing spots, easy access to gyms, dining, & nightlife. Quick drive to La Jolla & Birdrock areas, need I say more?  Oceanfront Pool and hottub are so relaxing - great for sunset and to take a nap on plush\n",
      "Everything about Pacific Terrace is perfect. Love the spa feeling when you first walk into your room. LOVE the security!  Someone tried to slip in behind a guest walking out and the guy didn't get more than a few feet before being turned around.\n",
      "Beautiful grounds, friendly staff and perfect location just steps from the beach. The sunsets from pool side were top notch. Thank you for a lovely accommodations for our time away from the hustle and bustle.\n",
      "This resort was so lovely. The rooms were luxurious and the staff is very helpful and attentive.   Amazing views of the ocean. Lovely heated pool and spa to enjoy. Balcony has nice lounge chairs that we enjoyed and listened to the waves.  So relaxing!  We will definitely be back on our next trip to San Diego!\n",
      "Pros.  The pool and hot tub were heated and perfect to swim in any weather.  They were perfect for kids as well. Nice location near beach.  Would not label beachfront since you have to walk down quite a few steps to access the beach sine the hotel is on a cliff overlooking the beach.  Very nice beach.    Cons : front desk rude and not helpful, especially the night crew.  They were just plain rude.  Made the stay uncomfortable.  Rooms dated.  Coffee on site but staff had a hard time figuring out how to make coffee.  Was ok.  Drinks were sweet with little liquor. Food was ok.  Horel ok and staff not so.  I would relate the service to a super 8.  Definitely not worth the money.  If it wasn't on the beach it would be a $100-$200/ night hotel.  Neighborhood is a spring break style.\n",
      "Stayed here for 5 nights over Memorial Day weekend. We had a double Queen Ocean front room. Room 309. Room was great. Spectacular view of the ocean. Beds and pillows were very comfortable.  Had a cup coffee maker.  Miny fridge that was very cold. Large bathroom.  Only suggestion would be to update the tub and shower. It does not live up to the hotel. We had room service one night and it was good.  Drinks at pool were also good but expensive.  Crown and coke was $18.  Only had one.  Hotel is near a lot of restaurants. We would stay here again if back I. Pacific Beach.\n",
      "The hotel was immaculate and the staff couldn’t be more friendly and helpful. Hard-pressed to beat the location (high-traffic boardwalk at your doorstep, the beach mere steps beyond that though you’ll need to traverse a significant staircase to get from boardwalk to beach level—something to consider if dealing with limited mobility). The view is amazing; well worth getting the full- or partial-ocean-view rooms. I’ve stayed all over San Diego (including many times at the Del in Coronado). I really Loved the vibe of this hotel; its cozy atmosphere is a break from the crowds (which are substantial at the Del) and fits perfectly with PB. Will definitely return and like will become my new go-to place to stay when I’m in SD.\n",
      "I booked via Booking.com, at the Pantai Inn. I booked a King Room, with no Ocean View.  From arrival at the Lobby, the front desk agent made sure I parked where I was allowed to park for the property. Then I was informed at the front desk, that I had to pay for parking ($25.00 a day). For a one-night stay, the stay was approximately $242.00 USD.  The property is considered a 4-star property. However, please be aware, they do NOT have a restaurant or bar, no fitness facilities, no pool, no room service either. Additionally, please be aware that possibly due to proximity to the beach, the entire interior of your accommodations may be damp smelling.  The layout of the accommodations was very comfortable and the decor was pleasing to look at. I was pleasantly surprised with how\n",
      "The staff at the Pantai Inn are incredibly helpful and accommodating. The ocean views are amazing, and the rooms are very comfortable. The breakfasts are creative and delicious. The outdoor space is comfortable and relaxing. We will stay here again!\n",
      "Wonderful Stay! stayed at 205..Staff are awesome, very helpful and accomodating! Location is the best just in front of the beach and restaurants are nearby! Awesome Breakfast!!!Ambiance of the hotel is very relaxing!!!Will definitely stay here again!!!\n",
      "Great inn and a wonderful stay.  We have stayed here several times before and this was our best visit,  We stayed in a large 2 bedroom and 1 bath unit in the first level right across from the ocean.  Unit was very well maintained and it was a great location with a wonderful view.  Breakfast was ok, similar to what you might find at a residence Inn.  Parking is additional $25/night.  We will be back\n",
      "The rooms are very unsafe for families. My 3 year old daughter opened the drawers on the dresser and it came down on her with a large piece of glass they had on top. The dressers should be secured to the wall, especially with loose glass on top. The management barely cared. Also, some of the rooms are in the building across the street. There is no elevator and they offer no assistance with bags, even up 2 flights of stairs. For the price I really expected better. At least the location is wonderful.\n",
      "We go to La Jolla twice a year, July and January. We’ve been making these trips for several years and would never consider any other hotel. The property is always immaculate and the staff is so welcoming and professional. The hotel manager, Edwin Zaragoza, always remembers us and always takes care of us, he makes us feel like family. The property is so beautiful because he is always refreshening and updating. We always enjoy our stay and can’t wait to get back. We highly recommend it for families, singles or couples.  Sarah C., Tempe, AZ\n",
      "This has been one of the best vacation experiences I've had in a long time.  Typically when I stay somewhere there is atleast one thing wrong with hotel if not more. When it comes to Pantai Inn there has been zero issues.  It's been quite the opposite.  The staff is great (especially Antonio), the breakfast is great,  it's 5 steps away from the cove, and the rooms are amazing. Worth every penny. My wife and I are already planning a bigger trip for summer. 5 stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟  all the way.\n",
      "We had booked a room with a partial view,  but when we arrived they said the room needed work after the rain storm so they upgraded us to the front top room.  THAT ROOM WAS AMAZING!!  The location of the inn is perfect, we parked the car for 3 days and explored on foot.  Great restaurants close by.  Beautiful view from our room.  Thanks\n",
      "I was part of a family group that visited La Jolla and stayed at the Pantei Hotel for 5 long weekends in 2022.  It is a beautiful hotel built and designed in Bali style architecture.  Our first visits were wonderful experiences at the hotel with the supportive hotel staff, great views of the ocean  and enjoyable experiences in La Jolla. We thought we had found our place to escape to the quiet, peaceful side of life.   Things declined in the last two visits. The Housekeeping Staff remained very friendly and helpful, but the  Administrative and Management Staff seemed much less friendly and supportive - especially over the New Year's  period.   It took away \"the magic of the place\" for us.   During my 40-year international carreer and  25-year retirement I lived and travelled in\n",
      "I went with my boyfriend and his family to stay here for News Year. We have stayed here before and things seem to go well apart from the squeaky beds.  This time was very different. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, the water pressure in the shower was horrible and the hot water took forever to heat up. I also found a bug in the shower.   There were 6 of us staying an a three bedroom with two bathrooms and there was not enough hot water after one person took a shower.  We were told that eat showerhead it’s all hot water unit but that is not true at all. Otherwise they were all broken.   We were going to move rooms the last night to the room we stayed in last time we stayed because although they were loud, and squeaky, they were a lot more comfortable. The morning we were\n",
      "Edgar Aguilar was a STELLAR valet! he went above, and beyond, I am a make up artist, and he carried all of my bags and chair into the hotel, and back into my car with a smile, and couldn’t have been sweeter! You can tell he takes pride in his work! Love this hotel it’s the best!\n",
      "Great hotel for business travel. Stayed here for a conference at the convention center and the rooms were clean and updated, restaurant was solid, and the pool was very nice for a few hours of r&r before a flight. Already booked my room for the same conference next year!\n",
      "Our new favorite place to stay when in San Diego is the Marriot Marquis. From the moment you pull up, you’re  whisked away to an experience where your every need is anticipated and expectations are met. From the Valet, to the Desk Staff, to the Bell Staff, and At Your Service, we were treated with respect, kindness, and superior service.   A big thank you to Ben from Valet and the Bell Staff Captain who made our already great trip, spectacular!\n",
      "Stayed here for two nights in early June during our visit to SD.  Pros - Beau at the front desk was great and greeted us upon arrival. He was attentive during a busy check-in time and ensured I was good to go. The room was comfortable and well appointed and the balcony sufficient. Great location along the waterfront and close to Gaslamp District, the Seaport, and walking distance to the Padres game. In-room coffee, on-site swimming pool, splash pad (in the shade), decent wifi, nice toiletries and comfortable bed. The amenity fee is a lot but if you use the services, can even out. We enjoyed the glass of wine from Pantry. The children’s museum (and a kids park) is located just across from the hotel - must do’s with little ones!  Cons - we weren’t told about the $15 daily\n",
      "Stayed here for a conference last month.  The food was incredibly good.  Our room had a side view of the harbor. Next time we come, I will request a room with a better view. The hot tub was excellent. One evening, our conference met on the Marina Terrace. It was wonderful. I would highly recommend a conference here. The service was exceptional. The bellhops won't let you get your own luggage cart so be prepared with cash to tip. The harbor was beautiful.  There were cute stores and vendors lining the walk.\n",
      "“Val the Valet” is the best Valet guy in the history of Valet guys. No joke.. this man needs more than just a raise! I had no charge left in my Tesla when I arrived to the Marriott and I would periodically run into him and he would go down and check if there were any chargers open for me. The day I was leaving, he found out there were chargers at the convention center and road his golf cart in front of me to show me where to go and took me in the cart to the convention center elevators. It was VIP treatment and Val deserves only the best review I could possibly give!!! Send this man on a nice trip! He deserves it. Customer service is something you don’t see anymore since Covid. He is truly a great human.\n",
      "Val the valet was cool as heck. He helped us off load our crap with a swiftness. Super rad guy, while singing along with our kick ass tune when we pulled up. The Roots, The Seed 2.0. We entertained the lobby for a solid 10 minutes!\n",
      "Val the valet was by far the best valet experience I’ve had in the last 5 years traveling to San Diego. Courteous, knowledgeable, and fantastic at coordinating the multiple lanes at the Marriott Marquis property. Outstanding employee and one who is passionate about his job….which is rare in this new economy. THANK YOU VAL!!\n",
      "Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina is a great place to stay with fantastic views and excellent customer service. The staff here is very friendly and accommodating to make sure that you have everything that you need for a quality stay every time.\n",
      "Great service. Val and Robert were wonderful Valets. Friendly, fast and organized especially during a busy holiday weekend. Others were courteous and helpful as well but I didn’t catch their names. No better place to park when you are staying at the Marriott Marquis and Marina\n",
      "This was my first stay at a Pendry Hotel.  The property was beautiful and my room was spacious and modern.  When we ate at the hotel, the service was great and the food was quite good.  I would defintiely stay here again.\n",
      "We just left after staying a night at the Pendry and can’t say enough about this hotel. We came in for a concert and wanted something within walking distance to Petco Park. Upon arrival at the hotel, they offered valet parking for $55 which was a bargain given parking nearby for the concert. The front desk staff was able to get us into our room early and the room itself was absolutely beautiful! The bed was super comfortable and the shower was amazing. We ordered room service after our concert and it was excellent (burger and club sandwich). The cost is within range of what we’d expect to pay for a hotel as close to Petco Park/the Convention center and we would definitely stay here again.  A++++!\n",
      "Staff and hotel were fantastic. Food and drink were also amazing. Entire hotel is great. Valet staff were really good. Valet line is a pain, waiting for room in the valet and driving in circles until space available is not the best. Overall will continue to stay at pendry, will recommend that friends and family stay as well.\n",
      "Our stay at the Pendry San Diego exceeded our expectations.  The hotel was beautiful and clean.  The restaurants were amazing!  We were traveling with our 10 year old son, upon arrival there was a special birthday surprise in our room!  It made his day.  We enjoyed the Pool House and the close proximity to Petco Park and all the amazing restaurants.  The best part of our stay was the exceptional hospitality and the kindness from the entire team at the Pendry!!  Truly unmatched hospitality. We will be back!\n",
      "We had a wonderful time celebrating my husband’s birthday  with amazing accommodations, incredible food, and the perfect location near Petco Park. We will definitely be back soon for another getaway to the Pendry.\n",
      "I came into town for the Rock N Roll Half Marathon and of course I was going to stay at the Pendry! They know how to do service & make you feel special. Brendel, Michael, & Luke on the bell team were available to help me during my stay and went above and beyond. I checked in with Amani and she was such a delight! So friendly, positive and genuine. Lisa & Rachel at the spa were splendid and welcoming as always! I spent the day at Pool House by the pool after the race and the music/vibe was perfect. Anees (so sorry if that's spelled wrong) was our server and she was amazing. I can't wait to come back!\n",
      "Everything from arrival, to personal touches, to ultimate professionalism, timeliness on requests, and attention to detail was top notch!  Even though I live in the same city/area, it felt like I was away on vacation in a utopia type atmosphere.  Huge fan and will definitely be coming back here again.\n",
      "Excellent! Customer service was wonderful!  One tip, the shower stall smelled of mildew but i think it was because there is hardly any ventilation due to the enclosed design. Other than that no complaints.\n",
      "Room quality far below what should be provided at this price point.  Crowded room with chipped, mismatched furniture.  A 3 star hotel room charging 5 star prices. Nice outdoor pool and good fitness facility.\n",
      "We ended up booking the Pendry as a last minute Memorial Day trip and had such a lovely time! The hotel was in a prime location right next to the Petco Stadium, plus plenty of bars and restaurants. The staff at the Pendry were very kind and efficient as well. We stayed with our dog and were provided with dog amenities like a dog bed, food and water bowls, and even a dog toy upon check-in. The gentlemen that checked us in, Marco, and the bellman that assisted us out were so kind and personable, it really made our stay. The hotel had plenty of dining options that were pet friendly and exciting events and parties all weekend. Glad we decided on this last minute stay!\n",
      "Rooms were clean, pool was nice & hot tub- housekeeping were the best!!!! Only suggestion would be to have pool towels near the pool. Loved it had floats for everyone.  The Waffle House had great breakfast!\n",
      "Kings Inn is great place for a less expensive price than surrounding accommodations.  My biggest concern when renting a room is cleanliness.  This place was clean.  We also received daily room cleaning which not all places are back to yet.  The bathroom is on the small side but fully modern.  Our room had been updated and everything was in good working order.  It has a nice pool and spa and an area next to the pool with seating and tables for socializing.  We actually brought back food a couple of times for the family and ate there as it was very pleasant.  There was a fridge in the room but the only microwave we found was located in the guest laundry room.  I want to give a shout out for exceptional customer service, especially Greg the night manager.  He put up with my family\n",
      "Love Kings Inn and will definitely stay here again when we visit San Diego next time! Here are the reasons:  1. We got a pool facing room ( #183). It's only 5 seconds walking distance from the pool and hot tub. Kids loved swimming in the slightly heated pool and mommy enjoyed watching them from the room. There's no noise issue from the pool at all during our stay.  2. The room is renovated so it's modern and cozy with a retro surf theme n color tone ( the Galanz mini fridge is really cute!!) The beds and pillows are comfortable. The bathroom is in a smaller size but fine for us. The sink is outside the bathroom so it's still accessible when the bathroom is occupied.  3. In and out from the room and the hotel is super easy. Walked few steps to our car and drove 30 seconds to\n",
      "Room was clean and comfortable but you need to use stairs to carry luggage upstairs. The shower made loud noise via pipes in walls and there is added parking fee that seems unnecessary considering the hotel is on a road with many other hotels and has plenty of parking. The hotel is close to highway and many attractions and offers two restaurants that you can buy food. Liquor store is next door.\n",
      "The front desk staff were amazing from the start! Pool was fun, kids had a blast! Super awesome that there's 2 really yummy restaurants at the motel. The only complaints I would have is that the pillows are lumpy and uncomfortable, we could hear every word the room next to us were saying, and the room was very dusty. Those are all minimal complaints though and I would definitely stay here again!\n",
      "So i personally like the hotel circle area.. it's very convenient for nearly anything or anywhere you want to go in the San Diego area.  This hotel has a classic stone entrance and vibe and cool outdoor look and decor.  It's fun to walk around at and i like the pool area.  The hotel had two restaurants the waffle spot and the Amigo Spot restaurant.   Lobby has a nice feel and they always seem to have it decked out with themes for the upcoming holiday.   I had a room with an interior entrance upstairs from the lobby.  The room interior was super clean and very comfortable loved the room for sleeping (essential). Bed was comfortable and everything worked well.  They have a cool retro new mini-fridge in the room.  The only thing is the view was to a walk way so everyone was walking\n",
      "The hotel building is older and has a cool vintage vibe, but the rooms are up to date and very comfortable.  The good-The room size was great, there was  fridge and microwave, it was clean, we had no problems or complaints about the room, and staff was very nice and helpful with questions about the area, and they cleaned our room every day, which I love.  The not so good-We were put on the 2nd floor, but there wasn't an elevator and with heavy bags it would have been nice to not have to lug them up the stairs. The Waffle spot coffee was good, but I was put off by the the signs everywhere giving specific instructions. I would stay there again because it's a great value for the money.\n",
      "Great experience.  Pillows aren't comfortable but other than that rooms are great and updated. I wish we could have got a late check out. Great service and was able to check in early. Will stay there again.\n",
      "I loved my stay here! The staff is friendly and check in was easy, the rooms were kept clean, the pool was great and we had an issue-free stay. The Waffle House is also great especially if you’re going with family.\n",
      "Nice location but old hotel. I can not say it was bad but the room could be better. We were charged 15$ / night for car parking which was quite much. It can be choosed for short stays but if you will be in san diego for more than 3 days I suggest to see more options.\n",
      "Wonderful location.  I loved the view.  The pool was awesome with slides and a walk in wading section for the little ones.  I also loved the firepits around the grounds as it was a little chilly when I was there. I recommend this hotel.\n",
      "Spacious, clean, comfortable room with views of the bay. We sooo needed this quick little getaway. Everything exceeded our expectations…from staff to room to amenities..kids loved pool, water slides and having food delivered poolside was so convenient. Lots of activities to do-we even got the 1free hour of kayaking in. What a great place to stay…would come back in a heartbeat!\n",
      "Everything were great!  Polite and well trained 5 Star staff members, from Valet, Front Desk, Room, to Breakfast!  The hotel even response to your text within the minute!  Great place for family, for sure will visit again!\n",
      "The refurbished rooms are nice but the rest of the hotel is in need of attention. Swimming pool area is crumbling and water was not clean. All four of us suffered from hearing and eyesight infections having used them. Limited food options, especially as some nights private events were being held - likewise the coffee shop closes at 3 pm. Also be careful using the laundry service, ours was lost and 24 hours later found with a significant overcharge - was promised numerous call backs without success until a chap on front desk took control of the situation.\n",
      "The Hyatt hotel on Mission Bay was amazing from check in until check out. the staff and overall experience was great. The pool are was wonderful from the slides to the fire pits at night at well as the Red Fin breakfast was a great experience.\n",
      "Beautiful views, excellent service, and very smooth trip. I saw a bird fly by my window. on the 15th floor, carrying a freshly caught bird - doesn't get better than that! I recommend staying here, and see if you can get a room with a view, it's stunning.\n",
      "Great Hotel I would definitely  recommend this hotel and will stay again! The hotel staff were very kind and helpful and my room had such a beautiful view. When I travel back to San Diego this will be my primary hotel.\n",
      "Excellent location and friendly staff. Close to kayaking and restaurants!  The hotel is clean and the room we stayed in had a panoramic beautiful view of the ocean! I would highly recommend this hotel for couples and families.\n",
      "Gorgeous location, beautiful rooms with breathtaking views, and very clean. The pool has two really fun slides that attract many kids and childlike adults, fish tacos are fantastic, and staff is friendly. If you don’t want to only eat at the hotel, you’ll need Uber eats or other delivery, a car, or bring some snacks with you.\n",
      "Beautiful view of the Marina from the Tower (9th Floor).  Rooms were clean with beds made with hospital corners.  Towels were nice and fluffy. Housekeeping was friendly and expeditious when requesting anything (i.e., hot water kettle, microwave ($25/stay), extra towels, water bottles).  Wish they had more water refill stations with hot water dispenser.  They only have one in the gym.  Not very convenient.  Kids enjoyed kayaking and paddle-boarding even though the weather was very overcast and cold.  Warning: Not enough self-parking spaces, but since I had already pre-paid, they comp'd valet parking for the night.\n",
      "I had the most amazing stay at La Valenica, highlight of my trip was relaxing at the pool!  I was looking forward to relaxing and reading my book. Leo was very kind and tentative. Always around to make sure I was taken care of and if I needed anything.  Very personable and made my pool day even better!\n",
      "The La Valencia hotel in La Jolla, California is a true gem that is perfectly located, with easy access to downtown La Jolla's many attractions, great restaurants and shops, and most importantly, the beach where you can see the sea lions basking in the sun on the rocks.  The hotel itself has a lovely classic and vintage charm and has clearly been well-maintained over the years, with attention paid to every detail. The breathtaking sunset views are simply stunning and will take your breath away, whether you're relaxing in your room or sipping a cocktail on the patio.  The pool is another standout feature of the hotel, with unbeatable views of the ocean. It's the perfect place to unwind, and the excellent service we received from Mike at the pool bar truly made our stay extra\n",
      "This beautiful jewel by the sea melts all my troubles away. This trip is my one big indulgence I have every summer after a long school year teaching 8th graders. There are times that I just sit and listen to the ocean from my room for hours with zero sense of guilt. I leave here feeling calm and recharged.  Mark is the BEST and most amazing concierge ever. You name it and he will do his best make it happen. If you’re having a bad day, he has an amazing ability to make you smile and forget your troubles for a spell.  I’ve been staying here almost every summer for about 12 years and always look forward to seeing all the wonderful folks here. The food, rooms, views, everything are what keep me coming back.  Love the La V!\n",
      "We just had a staycation at La Valencia and celebrated our daughters 14th birthday. We had one villa and the sky suite, both rooms were amazing. The panoramic ocean views from the suite were mind blowing. One of our favorite parts of the stay is getting a ride on the pink golf cart with Maverick. He is just awesome! We love everything about La Valencia and will be back again!\n",
      "I came to this bar solo after a client meet at George’s down the street and I’ve never felt more at home with coming to get a drink. I didn’t want to sit alone so I joined Nick and Trevor at the bar who made some of the best cocktails I’ve ever had while making me die laughing. 100% am coming back for sunset/ cocktails on my next date.\n",
      "This hotel is an amazing getaway! I went for a long weekend in desperate need of a relaxing break. The staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating; the rooms are beautiful, clean, and comfortable; the grounds/amenities are stunning; the Spanish style adds a special charm. I was worried about my street facing room being too loud, but the town is very peaceful at night and the staff would have happily accommodated a room shift if needed (Noah at the front desk was really great).   My only note of warning if you’re considering La Valencia is the price — staying here will mostly be worth the price tag if you can get a room with a view (which may carry an extra charge) and if you plan to hang out at the pool (which is absolutely stunning, by the way). But if you plan on spending\n",
      "There was so much to love about my stay at La Valencia.   First, Mark, the concierge, a paragon of gracious congeniality, was so friendly and familiar during our chat about life in San Francisco and entirely knowledgeable and informative about neighborhoods in the greater San Diego region. Mark, your charm and decorum should set the brand standard.  At La Sala Lounge, we enjoyed a lovely dinner served by Ryan because of his attentiveness and comprehensive knowledge of the menu and wine offerings. His suggestions were delectably satisfying. I could eat the shawarma spiced octopus daily and not tire of it. Also, thanks for the extra grilled bread for the juices of the grilled sweet water prawns.  The excellent conversationalist Mike kept the great vibes and Prospect Painkillers\n",
      "La Valencia is muy deliciosa! It was the most perfect dinner spot to watch the sunset by La Jolla Cove. The atmosphere is charming, the bathrooms were very clean, and there are multiple dining areas. The bar area is parlor like and comfortable with sofas, chairs, and high-top tables. The front patio has a good view of the strip with comfortably cushioned patio chairs, umbrellas, and a hip vibe. My 4 year old wanted to sit by the cozy fireplace in the main restaurant area but we opted to sit out on the bar-side patio. We had an excellent view with patio heaters to keep us comfortable. My husband ordered the 18oz bone-in ribeye. The texture and seasonings were perfect!  Both of our kids had the burger and fries off the kids' menu. The fries were very good. I ordered a chicken with\n",
      "My partner and I came to San Diego for a getaway trip. Turns out la Valencia is the best place to go! Jenni at the front desk was extremely welcoming, and made us feel like we made the right decision right away. It happened to be a very special weekend for us, as we got engaged. Mark, the concierge, was super helpful and made some calls to make things even more special. Called a local restaurant to get us a great ocean view seat, and even helped to arrange some local flowers! They were amazing. We will be coming back! Oh, and also, it’s just in the heart of everything so it’s perfect location.\n",
      "Loved everything about this lovely hotel.  The service, everyone was so friendly and genuinely glad to see us!  The food was great, we enjoyed all three meals from there. Nice wine list, yummy deserts and great, quality meals.  The place, this classic hotel is absolutely gorgeous but nicely  modern with comfortable pillows and sheets, and nice new bathrooms.  Also, the location is perfect.  So easy to get around, go for walks, and see lots of La Jolla!\n",
      "Location is perfect for a family with high school kids and older. Pool party for 21 and over was very live for a Saturday party. Location puts you in walking distance to PETCO park and all shops, bars, and restaurants downtown. We very.much enjoyed our stay.\n",
      "Fun hotel for our 30 yr anniversary! The rocker vibe throughout was fun. We felt like VIPs all weekend long, thanks to Kevin in Bar 206 bar with perfect service to Patrick at the Liquid Sunshine pool party, who made us feel at home, our Valet, Aaron w/a welcoming smile & Erica in the Maryjane’s cafe. Great people who understand customer service, which is rare these days! Thx!!\n",
      "Hardrock is beautiful, clean, comfortable, has great views, restaurants and very friendly associates. It was perfect for us being situated right next to Petco Park, as that was the purpose of our visit, but it was also a convenient location to get to Seaport Village and the maritime museums.\n",
      "It was okay. We did have a few issues that were being handled.  The staff is amazing! Very clean. The restaurant was great.  I would definitely check into options for alternative parking.  The charge for valet parking was a lot.\n",
      "Everything was first class. The staff was great, from the front desk, to baggage handlers, to floor staff and restaurants.  Everyone treated us well. Our room had a great view and was impeccably clean. Nice amenities. Near so many good places to visit. Loved it!\n",
      "The first thing I noticed when I entered the lobby is how wonderful it smelled and the cleanliness. The check in was easy, staff was great and very accommodating. Our room was large and spotless, loved the shower and bed super comfy.\n",
      "Hands down the best and most prompt service I have ever received at a hotel. Anything requested from the front desk was quickly accomplished and received. From bags, to any room servicing, to the valet. Everything was done quickly and efficiently.\n",
      "Room in general looked quite nice and the bed was comfy. Location at the entrance of Gaslight was very good. That's pretty much everything positive about this hotel.   We asked for a room pretty up high to avoid unnecessary noise, which was declined as the hotel was occupied a lot according to the staff. We faced the street, which was super noisy. In addition the valet parking door was below our room on the 3rd floor and was squeaking each time it opened. Without ear plugs sleeping was not possible.  Furniture was worn off a lot, the furniture in the bathroom was swollen due to humidity. The shower was not clean but still had hair inside from the previous guests. The shower was awful, once setting the temperature it took almost two minutes that the temperature was actually\n",
      "The location next to the convention center was great. The public areas of the hotel are pretty and well maintained. The rooms are tired from over use and while the fixtures were lovely at one time - likely within the last 5-8 years they were new - they are clearly not well maintained and are tired and worn out from overuse. The fixtures are dented, dinged up, sloppily painted over to hide scars and scratches, the carpet is saggy and crunchy. You know instantly that you don't want to walk around the room barefooted. Hard Rock could benefit from a break, a facelift, followed up by regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance.\n",
      "Fantastic location right next to Gaslamp District (lots of dining, shopping and nightlife options) and convention center  Nice and clean hotel. Staff were very kind and helpful. Would definitely stay again!\n",
      "there was water all around the room door next morning when I exited the room. My foot slipped, got my back injured (which was already sour) and I reported this to front office. She told me that housekeeping was cleaning the upper floors and hence water was coming down.\n",
      "Traveled with family. Great location but very noisy. So no sleeping in. Staff very friendly. No restaurant on site but have a caffe with a few drinks. Only down fall was no microwave in one room and no chairs in the other room\n",
      "We were super upset with our room. Our room was dirty and molds were everywhere. In our bed we found a recipe which it was surprising! If the bed was clean after previous customer why the recipe was there! Also, the towels were dirty. We called front desk and asked them to come upstairs and check our room but she refused! The same problem was in our checkout! When i complained about room she told me that they checked health inspection and mold in room isn’t supposed to be an issue! I asked her that we can go upstairs and check the room but she refused! They both were unprofessional and unfriendly. Beside the room dirtiness and worst customer service we got, we werent able to use the rooftop and chill outside! It was a private party which it was super annoying! Nothing was like\n",
      "The suit was dirty and molded. It smelled really bad. The towels were nasty. Overall, its all safety hazardous. I’ll download more pictures. Before, even book this place make sure read all the bad reviews. The rooftop area was designated for a party than forget about sitting and enjoying the view! For pool, you are supposed to walk the other side of building with too much stairs?!?!?\n",
      "If you want to be right near the seals and see them from your window, stay here! But make sure you request to stay in the NEW BUILDING ONLY!!! The receptionist with the purple hair gave great recommendations for nearby activities.\n",
      "You will get a great location and rooftop with an ocean view. Do not expect a great room, very basic, tiny bathroom for 1 at a time, humidity…yet if you look for ‘cheaper side’ and location this is it.\n",
      "Cockroaches greeted us in front of our room. The carpet in the apartment needs to be replaced it smells like a 70s Vegas casino. The people above us smoked cigars in the non smoking room. The people beside us had 2 barking dogs when the front desk clerk said no dogs allowed! Service dogs are always allowed but 2 French bullies who barked the whole night don’t think so.The place has no fire extinguisher not handicap accessible. They tell you about another parking lot near the terrace rooms no handicap parking spot.Major code violations! $1350 for that, pass on it folks.\n",
      "Hotel location was fantastic and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and courteous and helped with whatever I needed. Location could not be beat. You step out of the hotel and you're right on the cove.\n",
      "One of the worst stays I’ve had in La Jolla - would not recommend - dirty room with thin walls,  noise and rude management. As someone that has been to La Jolla and stayed in many different hotels, trust me when I say this the one of the, if not the worst.\n",
      "Great room in the Pines, helpful staff, and amazing rooftop deck made are weekend at the Cove amazing!  We loved being right at the cove enjoying the sunsets while listening to the sea lions. The area restaurants are walkable with lots of options.\n",
      "We had an issue upon check in but Peter saved the day!! He really listened and cared for us and took action to make our stay epic. The property and location are perfect and all of the amenities are great. We loved the cleanliness of the room and property. The room service made it sparkly clean!\n",
      "We are Hilton Diamond members.  The Bayfront is primarily a convention hotel but because of the location close to Petco and downtown (walkable) we decided to try it out.  Petco Park is directly across the street from the hotel and the walk to downtown restaurants was maybe 15 minutes (does not require a car).  The hotel is across the street from a Trolley stop which makes access very easy.  The view on the bay is excellent with boats of all sizes going back and forth all day.  The hotel offers a free hourly shuttle to Coronado Island and drops you off at the Hotel Del Coronado. The lobby is attractive and the rooms very adequate.  Because it was our anniversary the hotel was king enough to upgrade us to a corner King with great water views.  They also delivered a bottle of\n",
      "A great hotel, on a short walking distance from the San Diego Convention Center and the marina. We had a nice luxurious room with a view on the Coronado bridge. There’s a nice pool where they serve great bites and drinks. The beds are very comfortable!\n",
      "Jane’s warm and friendly welcome during check-in made for a delightful end to what was a hectic travel day for my wife and me.  Also, kudos to Shirish for her excellent customer service and initiative.  Since this would be our first stay at the Bayfront, I had called the day before to inquire about the expected view from the room selected during check-in on the app.  She patiently explained the views from both the even- and odd-numbered rooms.  After additional questions regarding the sights visible, Shirish took the initiative and mentioned the possibility of a different room assignment.  (Before our call ended, she confirmed the reassignment.)  After checking in last night, my wife and I were HUGELY surprised by the ‘new’ room assigned – a \"corner\" room with AWESOME views of\n",
      "Great location, clean property, friendly staff, fantastic view and very walkable to dining and activities. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Great for any type of travel. Pool is a bit small for the number of guestrooms, get there early. My first visit and I will be back.\n",
      "Hotel was totally booked but customer service still Very Good.  Clean & staff responded to request for shuttle on call vs. on the hr. /half hour. Friendly drivers on all trips.  Great location to make airport connection easy & fast!!! Thank you for a smooth trip to/from without any hassle.\n",
      "Worst Experience ever. The hotel staff is rude and I do not trust house keeping. This hotel only cares about booking a reservation and has zero integrity when regarding the safety and comfort of its guest. I went Memorial Day weekend and both  jacuzzi were broken. One had a black rope around it and the other was open simply because the water was hot. Children and adults were sitting in the water. Adults were drinking in the side line and the kids were in the middle. There were zero bubbles and not one time did I see any of the staff check the PH levels or chlorine. I wish I never let my children in that pool. They came home with pink eye, a cold, and hand foot and mouth disease. When I called to complain and ask how often they sanitize Barbie the Manager, her real name was\n",
      "Awesome place to stay with family . Kids feel welcome it is very good . I like the parking too . It’s on center as well. They clean the room every day. Very clean . Pool are great . Kids like the pool\n",
      "Stayed 3 nights as I was going to a Padres game which is super close by. The hotel is nice, all food and drink options are a bit pricy and there isn’t much around unless you go to the gaslamp quarter which I did a few times. Room was clean and stayed cooled. The reason for the 4 stars is because the bed was like all other Hilton beds I’ve slept in. I would wake up with my back killing me. This could just be me and my body just disagrees with there beds. Overall I would stay here again just next time I might bring some type of pad for my back or something lol.\n",
      "I went for Mother’s Day weekend with family. The hotel lobby is beautiful. I was greeted at the front desk by Jedd and Mariana who were both very friendly and accommodating. We got the Bayfront Suite with bay view which was spectacular! The room was very clean, well decorated. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Thank you to other staff members at front desk Peter, Hitomi, Andrew, Handy who helped throughout our stay. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing stay! Thanks Hilton Bayfront!\n",
      "Atwood was a great experience from start to finish. Me and my wife got married in the venue next door and Atwood provided a great experience for us and our family. Belen was who originally helped us and she was very friendly and informative. The rooms were big and very clean, the site itself was safe and quite. The location is prime where you are 10 minutes away from everywhere including downtown, all the beaches and balboa park. Thank you Atwood for providing a great experience and we will definitely be back again.\n",
      "Where do I start, the Atwood hotel is an affordable & hands down a great place to stay in San Diego where a lot of things are located near by, you have the malls, the liquor, as well as seaworld down the road. I wanted to point out that my room was in great condition, the atmosphere was phenomenal.   I had received outstanding customer service from Adilene, she was very friendly, I had any questions and or tips on where to eat out at she was their willing to answer my questions. She took action & presented hands down great customer service. Bright young lady.\n",
      "What a FABULOUS hotel to stay at in San Diego! The hotel is clean, and in a prime location on Hotel Circle- just a few minutes from Fashion Valley and the Transit Center! The staff: Lorena, Pierre, Victor, and Jose (just to name a few) were so helpful and kind to my mother and I throughout our entire stay! We decided to stay an extra night, and they were so accommodating! We have enjoyed this trip so much- and certainly recommend the Atwood Hotel! Thank you!\n",
      "Incredible service, clean rooms, friendly staff! Restaurant on the lot (crust Kitchen) is delicious and great for any meal of the day. Beds were very comfortable and plenty of space in the room!  Highly recommend, 10 out of 10 would stay again.\n",
      "The customer service here is warm and welcoming. I came into town to see a concert with some friends. We got separate rooms but they were able to put us next to each other and it was so cool! It was like having our own suite! Thanks Francisco and Lorena for all of the assistance and courtesy during our stay. The restaurant and liquor store in parking lot was so convenient and had amazing choices. Truly a comfortable stay with all the right amenities!\n",
      "This is billed as a cool, hipster-type retro-styled hotel. In fact, it's a 60-year old highway motel with a recent paint job that still needs further work.  Pros: Room was a good size, bed was comfortable, provided us with a Pack-and-Play for our toddler (though they seemed surprised when I asked for a bedsheet for it), there is a good-sized fridge in the room.  Cons: This hotel seems stingy on the towels - we were only given two bath towels, one hand towel and one face cloth for three people, and they were small and thin. We requested towels three times on the second day, were promised we would get them and never received them. I ended up having to take tiny pool towels (1.5 feet x 3 feet in size) to use in our bathroom. There was a communication breakdown with some of the\n",
      "I had a extended stay at. The Atwood the stay was very nice and theirs 4 people that made my stay even better. And I would like to give a special  thanks to  and that’s Victor and  Adilene at the front desk  Pricella with house keeping and Jose with maintenance the Atwood is very luck to have you 4 work for them   And you to the rest of the crew for makeing my stay a good one\n",
      "Great Stay! I’ve been booking at Atwood for over 5 years whenever I’m in San Diego. Pierre and Priscilla were extremely helpful & delightful at the front desk/ lobby, helping me extend my stay and even matching the lower rate after I overpaid online. I appreciate the awesome consistency of this calm and cozy hotel.\n",
      "The good experience started at the front desk. Pricilla was very nice. She recomended places ro see and things to do. She was not in a rush and gave us all her attention. The maintenance workers and other staff at the hotel were also very nice and helpful. Good location and quite.\n",
      "Let’s start off by correcting the name. MOTEL. It’s a motel. Good. Now… For the rooms- very basic, I feel like I could have saved $150 and had the same uncomfortable bed/pillow/basic room at a motel 6.  The pool is in a parking lot. At night sketchy people come through the parking lot on bikes/scooters. I did not feel safe here.  Every single hotel we’ve stayed at down the California coast as at least offered coffee in the morning. This one offers nothing. San Diego is such a beautiful big city- I would stay somewhere else.   Not sure how this had a tripadvisor recommendation- really questioning the legitimacy of all positive reviews.\n",
      "$310 + $30 \"resort fee.\"  This hotel is a dump.  It's very convenient to the airport, which is a benefit if that's what you need, but it's a dump.  Dark, old carpets, smelly, bordering on sleezy.  It's exactly halfway down the list of San Diego hotels, which list includes every cheap motel in town.  I'm not hard to please, really, I'm not, but I grade based on price.   Next, 4 p.m. check-in?  Really?  That's the best they can do?  You KNOW they will be happy to check you in early, at a cost.        The \"resort fee\" is the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n",
      "We found when we arrived at the Sheraton Marina that our room reservation was for the Sheraton Bayside down the street. The hotel considers the two locations interchangeable but the Bayside has only one sad bar/restaurant, a small pool, and a tiny lobby. It’s not at all the same as the larger, livelier Marina with a Starbucks and three dining establishments and two lovely pools. Then we were told we’d be in an “upgraded” room on a high floor, but it had a Murphy bed. Because this was the only one on offer for us we took it. The room was nice with a sofa and great view, but the bed was a queen, not a king, and the Murphy-ness meant it was not the kind of fantastic hotel before hopes for. On the positive side, there are airport shuttles every half hour and a breakfast items kiosk\n",
      "The room we stayed in, was updated and very comfortable. I want to especially acknowledge Aiden, Paulina, and Arthur. Aiden was our waiter in the restaurant, and Pauline. was a hostess, and they went above and beyond to  ensure that we had quality service. Arthur worked at the front desk and was very knowledgeable and took his time explaining different venues, we could go to with our family. The only drawback I saw was there was no number to connect to the front desk. When the cleaning crew came in, they did not resupply us with any coffee or water items. The only number I did see for the hotel was connected to a voicemail that said to leave a message, and they would get back to you , which they never did. All in all it was great experience.\n",
      "Checked into this hotel and am very happy so far. The Bellcap gave great recommendations for lunch in Little Italy. Room has been renovated recently. Have amazing view of the marina with a balcony for quiet nights. Beautiful bathroom with lots of room and amenities.   Do nice.\n",
      "Very friendly service at the lounge in the bay tower, the housekeeping was friendly prompt and left everything clean. The front desk staff in the daytime  jasiah was amazing helping me with all requests. He went above and beyond to help me. The parking price point is ridiculous thou\n",
      "We we’re completely unaware of the major SCAM this hotel pulls on guests who do not book directly with the “Marriot Bonvoy” app. If you get a room with mini water bottles, they will charge you a fee even though they purposely put a sign on them saying “With compliments from Marriot”. If you do not have a reservation number from the app, you cannot get points for your stay. You also cannot get access to most amenities, and WiFi is just the start. There’s TONS of hidden transactions that they will not tell you. Do not stay at this hotel, we made the mistake of booking third party to save on travel, but little did we know that they would place us in the Bay Tower, which is basically the toilet bowl of this hotel. The building is old, with barely any modern upkeep. It smells of sea\n",
      "It was my first time visiting SD & overall I had a great fun time. The only thing that didn’t help was the overcast the whole weekend, other than that the hotel service was great. The check in & check out process was smooth. Had fun riding the Jetski’s and enjoying the pool & jacuzzi.\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel because the conference I was attending was being held there. Rooms online look picture perfect and upscale; however, be aware that these are just their renovated rooms in the main tower.  The shuttle from the airport was very convenient!  Upon arrival, my team of 4 went to go check in. The front desk receptionist was immediately overwhelmed and flustered that 4 of us needed to check in. She ended up grabbing another staff member to check 2 in. She put us all over in the Lanai Building and that’s where the problems started.   First, the room written on my key didn’t even exist. My coworker was given a key to a room that already had other people staying in it. Seriously?   The Lanai Building was very run down and not at all what is advertised online. Musty,\n",
      "Perfect getaway. Aaron Mendez front desk was an excellent representation of efficiency. He handled a minimum of 5 customers to 1 of his coworkers. He kept smiling and welcoming each guest even though the line kept growing. Thank you Aaron for being wonderful in a very hectic environment. The hotel was clean comfortable and everyone was pleasant. Love the location as it was easy to walk or Uber. Appreciated the airport shuttle as it was seamless also.\n",
      "daily resort fee of USD 26 plus tax will be added to the room rate-includes various amenities.  But despite calling and asking the bell captain seven hours later still no soap.  Is soap an amenity. When I asked again at midnight I was told it would take quite a while so second shower with no soap occurred.  This ridiculous charge is for really nothing except the right to pay $6 for water from the gift store  And so on so forth. $47 plus taxes for parking on a dirt lot.  This hotel is simply taking the piss. Had to wait until 3:50 pm to check in and no soap.  What kind of craziness is this and they want me out at 11 a.m. so they can take 5 hrs to clean a room but not provide any soap for shower.   Now why is it I am a Bonboy member with millions of points.  Marriott get your\n",
      "Another remarkable staycation experience at the Fairmont Grand Del Mar! Top notch hospitality in every detail. From Kai and Neil at the front desk remembering us from last years visit and their thoughtful handwritten note and gift of delicious chocolates that was hand delivered by Neil. Excellent hospitality from valet, bell man, room service, turn down service, house keeping, restaurants, and concierge, thank you Dinet and Irene. Room service was delicious. While taking the hotel hiking trail, which had grand views, we passed by their horse stable. The horses were beautiful, healthy, and happy. The hotel grounds are superbly manicured as always. The jasmines are in bloom and very fragrant. Our stay was just what we needed, a relaxing getaway. The male staff are all handsome and\n",
      "I have stayed at the Fairmont Del Mar several times.  It is the only hotel I stay in when visiting San Diego.  The hotel staff (every one) is simply fantastic.     I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and the canyon views.  Look forward to visiting again.\n",
      "Beautiful resort with every amenity! Pool is heated to 82, which was nice since it was cloudy and cold during our visit. Great restaurants and all around friendly and attentive staff. Beautiful grounds to stroll, excellent restaurants and comfortable beds.\n",
      "Wow!!! We were so impressed with everything on this trip. This is one of the nicest hotels in Southern California with first class service.  From the way Neil helped us at check-in, he made our trip so memorable. It was our anniversary and he sent us some chocolates it was wonderful. We can’t wait to get back there ASAP! Thank you Fairmont but especially Neil for a great trip!\n",
      "Well, I rarely write reviews but feel it's only right to give the realities with as little bias as possible.  We stayed here years ago and my daughter mentioned milk and cookies as we got out of the car.  Ten min later we got to the room and milk and cookies were delivered.  The doorman had overheard the comment and followed through.  That's the type of employees that work here.  I am pleased to say the employees at the hotel still maintain that bar.  They are very hospitable and aware and do what they can.  Unfortunately,  the management of the hotel in general (not calling out the manager, just the general policies, maybe pushed from corporate, I don't know) just makes the experience feel like a money grab.  Let me explain.  First, there is basically one restaurant. Addison\n",
      "We had an amazing 5 day family reunion trip at the Grand. The Fairmont owning it is a great property manager. All the staff including Muriceo, Neil, and Kai are fantastic. We enjoyed the pool with our 3 kids. We stayed in a nice Paseo suite. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Top notch staff, great facilities and beautiful surroundings.  There’s a bit of construction going on but it didn’t impact our stay at all. It’s a few miles from great shopping and dining at UTC as well!  I’d love to return and stay a bit longer.\n",
      "I came for the Mother’s Day tea and it was the worst experience I have ever had. The food was horrible, you could tell that all the pastries were stale and made before hand. Everything was either too dry and bland or too sugary and rich. They needed a better balance of food to create a food journey (what I would expect for the price). The servers didn’t know what they were giving us and two times, I was given fish eggs even though I ordered vegetarian foods. The location of the tea was in a huge room with horrible acoustics, you could hear everyone talking because the space made the volume magnified which also caused you to hear every dish clink, stack and break. Terrible from start to finish.\n",
      "Apart from the gorgeous property with such breathtaking architecture; Simona from concierge made our visit to San Diego better than expected. She’s such a gem; she genuinely cares about people and curated a last minute itinerary for the Torrey Pines that turned out to be one of the best activity during our one week visit to San Diego. God Bless Simona. My wife and I are ever so grateful to her and the entire team at Fairmont. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay extra special.\n",
      "From the moment we stepped out of our car we were impressed.  Stunning hotel, opulent rooms and beautiful grounds.  I retired this week and this is the start of my retirement dream trip.   The hotel actually sent me a gift and card because I mentioned it when checking in.  As well the food so far has been amazing.   Can’t do it justice with just this short review.  Highly recommend!!\n",
      "Town and Country Resort was our first family vacation and we enjoyed every aspect of the resort. The staff were excellent, though our favorite was Maggie at the pool! The MRKT was a great place to get breakfast each morning and we had an absolute wonderful time at ARLO. John at ARLO was very accommodating with our son and made the experience very memorable. My family will definitely be back to visit and I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a great place for a family vacation.\n",
      "Came for a conference- my room was adequate but what I really loved was the landscaping… lots of nice trees and flowers which made it pleasurable when walking around the property. Meeting food was very good and had an excellent meal at the main restaurant (?Arlo). The gym was well appointed and clean.\n",
      "Second time staying here and couldn't be happier. The resort is very clean and well maintained. Staff is very attentive and friendly. I highly recommend Town and Country Resort. I do all my booking through Lucy Gomez. She is wonderful and really caters to all your needs.\n",
      "The rooms have been updated. Staff was friendly even when problems arose restaurant general manager and managers were willing to listen and fix any problems. Front staff friendly and welcoming and kind.\n",
      "This is a perfect family destination. We have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, and Town and Country is so far our favorite. From the Front Desk staff who greeted us warmly, to the overall ambiance of the hotel, and to the many amenities and activities the hotel had to offer. We enjoyed hanging out around the fire pits as a family. We watched The Sandlot movie at the pool. The rooms were exceptionally clean. The bed was comfortable. Highly recommend visiting their restaurant, Arlo, and try the squid on the menu. I’ve never had squid so tender! Fish and chips at the pool restaurant was so delicious. Resort is conveniently walking distance to Fashion Valley mall. We will definitely come back! Thank you Town & Country!\n",
      "Loved the environment, rooms were great!! My husband and I like the fact that you can only enter the elevator with a key, the safety of their customers is important. All the fire pits were an extra touch to our evening.\n",
      "The ambiance was great. Lots to experience. The staff was very professional and attentive to our needs. They were very informative when it came to the response to our questions and concerns. The check out process was made very easy. Parking was great. We will  be coming back soon.\n",
      "The hotel was very nice and clean, and the staff was extremely polite and friendly. The atmosphere was very relaxed and kid friendly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this establishment.\n",
      "Absolutely loved our stay! Loved the whole resort, everyone was helpful and very attentive. There was a smaller more private pool by our room or you can hang out at the main pool. Food was reasonable priced and delicious. Lots of seating and entertainment around. There are fire pits placed all around, hammocks, a volleyball court and a few cornhole boards around the area and also a ping pong table near the main pool. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "I went for a convention. The hotel is great and can accommodate many people. The service is very good and people were welcoming. .The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Great place for family vacation as well.\n",
      "I think this hotel is good if you are on a budget and don’t need much in the way of expectations.  Water in the room didn’t get/stay hot as all and the room had a little musty smell. I don’t recommend for single women travelers, as it is a garden style hotel. It is a bit on the outskirts of downtown, but does have a mall and the train/buses close by.  It is right by the highway so it got a bit nosey at night, but again, it’s ok for short stays.  The food (breakfast) was pretty good as well.  The spa looks really nice, although I didn’t try it.  At the time, the rental car office was close but expected to possibly resume late 2023.\n",
      "Stayed 4 nights here at the handlery. We asked for a price at front desk upon arrival, and they suggested to book it online because the price would be much lower. Good service ! They give out free pancakes for kids at breakfast with purchase of 1 adult breakfast. Parking is 10$ a night but most hotels charge for that in SD. The pool area is large, clean and well kept. The hallways are a bit dated and dark, but rooms fulfilled our needs, the beds are comfy, clean and the room quiet. The hotel it self is placed close to downtown, beach and shopping centers. We would stay here again for sure. Thanks from Family Nielsen.\n",
      "They sheets have holes and they charge me  deposit but not return the money and when I see it in first hour go to the room I see it and I take it a picture and I show thin and the office recorded that\n",
      "Really poor experience at this hotel this past weekend.  From check in to check out, it was a very disappointing experience. Our reservation clearly stated we had early check in privileges, but when we got to the hotel at 2pm, we were told the room was not ready and they would email when it was.  No email was ever received. Finally checked back at 4pm to be told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Rooms are old and dated. The a/c was inoperable, as was the phone in the room. Staff rude and disinterested. Disappointing. Would not recommend.\n",
      "This is a good budget hotel in Hotel Circle N. The check-in was easy, The room trying to find it not so much. It was kind of outside and up some stairs, no good if you have kids or lots of luggage, and yes it was raining.  The room and bed was very comfortable and spacious and so was the shower.  For the price paid it was very good\n",
      "I have been coming here for over a year, about once every 3 months and on a special occasion so I’ve REALLY experienced this amazing team of professionals.  Benjamin is incredibly compassionate about hospitality, taking care of people and stretching as best as possible to make people happy and comfortable with their stay, especially me!  His team: Pamela, Cheryl, Shikira, Maria and Stephanie are ALL fabulous!  I get excited to come here because the staff makes me feel GOOD and does their best to accommodate any needs I have.  GREAT Service here at the Handlery Hotel! ~KP(A new addition to the family☺️)\n",
      "Overall a good hotel for a good price. Wasn’t too far away from the waterfront. Just a $10-15 Uber ride. The pool area is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant were nice. The rooms were clean and recently updated and generally quiet. The only downside was there were no fitted sheets on the bed and we ended up  directly on the mattress every night. I requested new sheets 3 times during our stay and never got a fitted sheet.\n",
      "The Handlery is located in the Hotel Circle area of San Diego. It has a motel look and feel but is actually great value for money. It has a heated pool, very comfortable beds and is superclean. It may not look as modern as other motels in this area, but has virtually the same on offer for a much lower rate. Only downside is that the Hotel Circle area is not very attractive. It has a lot of hotels but no restaurants, bars or even a convenience store like 7 Eleven. Also the Handlery does not offer lunch, which means that at lunchtime you’re on your own (getting crisps from the vending machine is the only option really). Breakfast service may be a bit chaotic at times but the food on offer is good. Bar prices are reasonable but the bar closes early, on some days even at 9PM. So\n",
      "Every time I come here. I have an amazing stay here at the Handlery Hotel in San Diego. The breakfast is outstanding here always. Maria & Cheryl two staff employees are extremely helpful. I always look forward coming here each time. I highly recommend this hotel to stay at in San Diego. I give the Handlery Hotel 5 Gold Stars. Sincerely, Layne Spelber\n",
      "Great employee's  when I arrive they were friendly and made you feel like your home. Cle rooms pool is outstanding food good size portions could have more variety. Best Pina coladas. Parking is not free that is a bummer it adds up when your staying a week. Pet friendly had a great time front desk manager and staff were the best.\n",
      "The hotel is comfortable enough, but at this price woudl expect a lot more. The customer service was mediocre and most worryingly I just noticed that even though my stay was organised by the company I was working for the Sheraton has charged my credit card in an unauthorised way and it is now very hard from abroad to even know how to get this back.\n",
      "this is an OK hotel, but not up to Marriott quality. the beds are new and great. The \"renovated rooms\" were out of the 1990s (the decor and the carpeting, and the hotel is made up of 6 or so separate buildings. That may be OK in normal SD weather, but if it is raining and cool, the arrangement is not great. also, the lobby is small and the drive to get to registration is very tight. finally, I registered on the Marriott website for a garden view room (for ~$10 extra per night). But I was given what the front desk described as a much better view, the view of the apartments and shopping center behind the hotel. there are better choices in La Jolla for the same or less money.\n",
      "Let's get the obvious out of the way - this is an older property; although it has been renovated, the age of some features is still obvious.  The hotel is located close to the freeway (but no noise issue) and within walking distance to a few large shopping centers with plenty of dinning choices.  The fist thing that jumps out at us was the interesting setup of several low-rise buildings surrounding a pretty lush and pleasant center courtyard where the pool, jacuzzi and a fish pond are located.  in terms of facility, our kids enjoyed the outdoor (but heated) pool and there is well-stocked fitness center. We had a standard room with two queen beds.   The room is well laid-out and clean.  It has a microwave and fridge.  Lighting  of the room is good and the wood shutters are a nice\n",
      "I stayed here for two nights in October with my fiancée after a few days in San Diego.   The property is a large property with a number of different buildings, housing the rooms, surrounding a central plaza / pool deck area.    Customer service throughout was great.  We arrived a bit early, but our room wasn’t ready, but they allowed us to keep our bags there without any issue.   When we checked in, we had been upgraded to a larger room, which had a seating area with a couch and table, a large bed,  and a decent sized bathroom.  Bed was comfortable ans the room was clean.  The rooms not run down or anything, but could maybe use a refresh. The main floor of our building was having renovations done, but I didn’t notice any interruptions.   The pool and hot tub area was large, and\n",
      "A classic, low rise facility. This place has been here for decades, but is as fresh & delightful as ever. The pool, spa, grounds isolate you from the bustle of the surrounding area. Make sure & request the garden view rooms. For you platinum & above, the club service & food was great\n",
      "This hotel has a very unusual set up. There are several outdoor paths that lead to many buildings to get to the rooms. Our room was the furthest - had to walk down 2 long paths  (past the pool) then swipe hotel key card into a building, then take an elevator to our floor, then walk through doors to a few outdoor rooms to reach ours. It took a few minutes just to get to our room. These open paths are a security issue. The paths are open to anyone with no visible security. No walkway signs telling you how to get to the front desk. If any issue should arise, the front desk is a few minutes of a walk from the paths. Definitely was a concern to me walking alone at times. Front desk staff are very nice & helpful. Rooms are a fairly nice size but could use an update.\n",
      "As others have said this hotel appears dated, but the building I was on had floors being refurbished.  Short trip from San Diego Airport.  Easy checkin.  Very unique building set up. I'm  Marriott Ambassador & I don't remember a hotel set up like this.  Several buildings around common courtyard with a swimming pool/hot tub/pond with koi.  My building was the farthest from checkin.  If it was raining, you'd need to walk thru other buildings to stay dry.  The building I was in I had to use key to enter the building to use elevator to the 3rd floor.  I then exited the common area by the elevator thru glass doors to my room, which was on an open walkway with steps to the exit to parking lot.  For safety reasons, if I had female staff member or my daughter staying there, I wouldn't\n",
      "Our weekend at the Sheraton La Jolla was perfection from the time we checked in to our departure.  The recently refurbished rooms were beautiful and the beds incredibly comfy! Every morning we enjoyed the delicious complimentary Starbucks coffee in our room to start the day off.  Check-out was conveniently done through our email.  We look forward to more visits at this wonderful Hotel.\n",
      "Ok..hadn't been here for several years due to CoVid. But before that, was a regular due to the good location and great pool. I did notice that the rooms had been renovated, which is good as they were previously pretty dingy.  However, from my first contact with the front of desk staff - WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!    Got in at 3pm after a long drive, and expected to get my room as check in time is 3 pm . But no - there were none available, and another 20 people ahead of me waiting to get a room. Clerk at front desk was aggressive and rude about it, just blaming everything on \"CoVid\". She said she would take my phone number, and give me a call when a room was free.   So 2 hours later, still no phone call...so went back to see what was going on. The aggressive woman hadn't even kept my\n",
      "The hotel is a bit dated, which is not a big problem. Still bearable and cleanish. However, the sheets were worn out and very uncomfortable. Even kids were complaining about how rough and itchy the sheets were and took a long time to fall asleep.   We were there for the UCSD school tour, which is walking distance from the hotel.  About 18 minutes walk to student center.   The pool is good size and looks nice but we didn't have time to use it.  Parking charges $25, but can walk 5 minutes and park on the street.\n",
      "Love the ambiance. The old-fashioned feel of the whole place is exactly what i was looking for. I only wish there were business which opened early, or a convenience store closer. Otherwise it was perfect.\n",
      "I stayed at the Sofia with a friend for a short vacation. It's a beautiful hotel and the room was very clean and pleasant. The room was tiny, especially for two people but we only spent enough time in the room to sleep. The hotel is located downtown within walking distance of many attractions, including Seaport Village, Gaslamp Quarter, Little Italy, and the port. Although the hotel seemed busy, it was surprisingly quiet with almost no noise in the hallways or from adjacent rooms. Good price for the quality and location.\n",
      "Great room.  A little pricey. Close walking distance to Gaslamp District.  Rooms were quiet, clean, and has a nice historical feel.  Close to trolley service.  Good value.  The area feels safe after hours and perfect location near Convention Center and MLB stadium.\n",
      "The hotel was in a great location and the rooms were clean! I loved the water refill stations on every floor. There was a slight hiccup though as the staff accidentally checked us out a day early but it was quickly resolved.\n",
      "We had a very good stay at The Sofia Hotel. Great staff, friendly and helpful. Clean, well located, near Balboa Park and Little Italy. The cleaning staff were very nice and did a good job. The parking is conveniently near the hotel.\n",
      "We chose this location due to the distance to Petco park and the pricing was a little more than what we wanted to pay but it worked out. Parking was directly behind the hotel and that made a big difference.\n",
      "Cozy little historic hotel downtown without the cost of some of the larger brand name hotels. I was completely happy with my stay and would stay here again when I'm next in San Diego. Friendly staff, gym was nice, rooms are large enough and comfortable.\n",
      "Small room, bad pillows, hidden resort fee and expensive parking. Wall is thin as paper, we were woken up by neighbors TV at 2am. Front desk is super rude, refuse to come up and instead ask us to move or leave, and hang up on us.\n",
      "Me and my husband went to celebrate our anniversary. We had a great experience the hotel was very nice the staff was very friendly as well. It wasn't to far from Gaslamp.. Me and my husband walked to all the locations.\n",
      "The Sofia is close to a lot of fun spots in San Diego, and is nice and affordable! The check-in and check-out process was very easy, and having the parking lot right behind the hotel made our stay very easy!\n",
      "The carpeting was not clean. I was there 5 nights and the Maids told me they could not come in to clean anything until I checked out. I asked them for clean towels and they said I had to go to the office to get them. They advertised a kitchenette but the microwave didn't work at all. There was not even a plastic glass to drink water from. The blow dryer only worked if you held the button on the wall down. I had to go to the office twice to reactivate my room key. There was no breakfast or even coffee. There was one roll of toilet paper for 5 days. Very sad.\n",
      "Originally intended to stay 28 days but after three nights we decided to find a cleaner hotel with a kitchen . We were originally quoted $125 a night, but we’re billed $140 a night. When I called about the discrepancy, they couldn’t care less.  Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. We found Extended Stay America in Mira Mesa to be much better, and a good rate.\n",
      "you can not imagine how we were so happy to do the fantastic trip, every thing was more than perfect, enjoyable stay which we will always remember it, all the family are waiting for our repeated stay.\n",
      "We arrived in San Diego in the late afternoon and made a same day reservation with California Suites using the Booking.com App. As soon as I received the reservation email confirmation from Booking.com I instantly realized that i had just booked the wrong hotel. Within minutes I attempted to cancel my reservation using every option I could find on Booking.com....multiple cancellation requests via the app, tried several customer support phone calls, and sent emails to Booking.com and California Suites informing all parties that this reservation was made in error. Since California Suites was close by and we had just paid $278.84 USD we decided to drive by and see if the hotel was somewhere we would want to stay, and if it was we would just keep the reservation and save the hassle\n",
      "This is solidly meh. Clean bathrooms and beds, but there’s chunks missing in the flooring in the hallway.  Extended stay is available so there are rooms with their doors open with folks just chillin. Some noise after hours.  The rooms were clean but a little beat up. If the rates are cheap it’s fine for a night or two. Pool seemed very clean. Parking felt secure.\n",
      "We were on a mission trip with 7 other mature adults. We made a reservation ahead, on line. The check-in person demaded he needs a COPY of our DL/passports. When I asked him why and said I believe it is unlawful (he has the right to check it to verify indentity, but never make or keep copies by Cali law). He said in a cocky way that we can go somewhere else??!! Manager was not available, it was late, we were tired- busy schedule, so we stayed. The place is a bit shady and remembers better times. Good from far and far from good. Attitude did not change upon our check out...a lot of pride and space for communication and cs skills.  I would give it 1 star (we were safe and the room was old, but clean) and stay away. I have over 35 years of CS experience and would never think they\n",
      "Room was spacious with a microwave and mini fridge. Nice pool/hot tub area. Secure entry to the hotel grounds. Outlets were loose so chargers kept falling out. Shower was so loud. Kid running around pathways all hours of the night screaming. Over all decent local owned hotel that could use some updating.\n",
      "As another reviewer stated, the service at this place is abismal. But that wasn’t the worst of it.  Here’s a brief rundown:  1.  It’s verrry old, run down.  2.  Bed was awful, serious dip in the middle and wife and I kept running in to each other. 3.  AC is a JOKE!!  Don’t visit in the heat or you’ll regret it. Swamp cooler, LOUD all night, room was steaming hot upon arrival and never cooled down all night.  AC would run for five minutes then the fan ran for 10 minutes and so on.  It was a feeble attempt at cooling the room. 4.  Shower was nice, that’s the highlight.   5.  No money goes back in to this place.  There’s a spot at the top of the stairs where you can see the plywood cracking.  Had me thinking of the Florida tower that collapsed. 5.  For $172 on a Saturday night I\n",
      "The service at this place is abismal. Good luck getting ahold of the front desk between 10:00pm and 8:00am. Couldn’t even get a fresh towel. Old, run down. Put us in wrong room to start with. TV didn’t work. Would not recommend this place if you are looking for any kind of real service. Definitely cheap, but this time I got what I paid for — cheap.\n",
      "We used this hotel/motel as our accommodation in February 2020. The key here is that I asked for a renovated room. The renovation must have taken place in the 1990s. We were here for only 3 days and that was enough. I also requested a handicapped bathroom - perhaps this was the renovated part of the room because this met the requirement. The breakfast was mediocre at best. If this will be a thing of the past because of the pandemic, you will not be missing anything.  The location is right off the highway, down the street from a nice shopping area, and is convenient.  You can stay here but don't have great expectations.\n",
      "The rooms were super spacious and clean. Staff were super friendly. The only thing is the parking spaces were super narrow and I worried about damage to my car. The pool is super small so if you have a large family it may be disappointing. The other concern is the entrance to the hotel. It is very narrow as well. Watch out when you turn in to the property, only one car can fit when entering and exiting. There is a Jack in the Box right next to the property and if it is busy you will have trouble turning in the property. Other than that it was a good hotel experience.\n",
      "The first half of my vacation would have been ruined were it not for Joe's (front desk manager) hospitality. After a scary start to my night Joe's knowledge and experience along with excellent customer service helped me through a time-sensitive issue. I cannot overstate my appreciation for his guidance and knowledge...Dickson is also terrific.  As far as the room and my stay are concerned, they met my high expectations that I had for this hotel. Would recommend this specific hotel again. This is not a fake review.\n",
      "The place is truly outdated: 1) Carpets in room and hallways need to be cleaned. Cause mildew smell 2) Elevators have temporary certification and both make very strange noises. 3) Room was smelly. 4) Room was outdated. 5) Room widow latch was broken and they it fixed by adding a small latch on top of the broken latch. 6) Room air-conditionters are smelly and very noisy. They need servicing. 7) No towel racks in the bathroom, yet they want you to keep using the same towels 8) Spots all over the carpet in the room. One was dark red and I hoped it was not blood. 9)TV menu did not reflect what was on TV. Totally out of sync. 10) Mattress had a plastic cover that kept slipping of. I did not know why and never experience this before at any Hilton. I checked and found that the mattress\n",
      "Poor service and room was filthy.  When my family and I checked in, we walked in with face masks because we weren't sure what the hotel protocols were.  As the front desk person checked me in, he asked for my ID and CC, proceeds to cough on my ID and CC then hands it to me with a smile.  Such rude and disgusting behavior.  I don't care where he sides with Covid or mask protocols.  What he did was disgusting.  I looked at the other front desk person on all he did was chuckle.  I love hilton hotels but I suggest you save your money and go elsewhere.  Avoid this location.\n",
      "It was easy to get on and off the freeway to and from the hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Many eating places are nearby within walking distance. This is an old hotel. It would be nice if the windows could be replaced with double or triple pane windows so that it could reduce the traffic noises from the street and freeway.\n",
      "I’d give half a star if I could. I booked a room for the night and paid $171.61. The original date was Feb. 10 a Friday night. I ended having to rebook because my husband got sick. The date I rebooked for was March 4 on a Friday and was charged an additional $87.08. I was never informed of this charge or else I would have cancelled all together. Add $15 to park so I paid 273.69 for one night at hotel that was not great at all. When I called to inquire of the charges I was told by the representative I spoke to him personally and I was informed because he always informs guests of the additional charges (btw this rep had a snappy attitude). So if your in the area and need a place stay save your money and the headache and go somewhere else.\n",
      "When we arrrived Kelle was the front desk girl. She was rude and short with her answers. We gave her the confirmation number and she still told me I needed to pay for the room for the night when I was paid for already. I felt like she felt she was doing me a favor. I travel for business a lot and never have felt the need to write a review until now. I will be removing Hilton from my list of travel locations and I feel Kelle is not the face that Hilton wants to represent them.\n",
      "Quiet and well maintained. Bed was very comfortable, room was clean and large. Plenty of parking. On-site security, other reviews mentioned the homeless parking lot near the hotel. We did not experience any issues with that nor did we feel unsafe. Good location and price for us.\n",
      "Great people at  a check in, freely staff through the hotle. Clean and well appointed suites. Our room over looked the pool, that was clean and well maintained. The staff had a Halloween pumpkin carving competition that looked fun.\n",
      "Sandra and Emma were extremely accommodating and flexible to changes I asked to make during the meeting days. Lunches were wonderful and the staff in the restaurant very good. I asked to make changes to original food and location and they did a great job! Thank you!  The public bathrooms were not very clean and even after asking for maintenance. Toilets' didn't flush and these were being used by meeting participants.  We did have an incident with one of the guests following an employee from BC to their room. The front desk attendant Sam was very accommodating to change her room and did ask if we wanted the police called. He handled it very well.  Thank you for the good experience!\n",
      "It’s very convenient if you’re going to be playing golf at Torrey Pines. It’s not going to knock your socks off,  but the views give it a boost. The service at the on site restaurant was excellent. The valet was quick and courteous. All that said, I refuse to give better than average for the following.  No soap in the room.  After filling out the card and dropping it off at the front desk, I still was not provided soap, in addition to fresh towels, more coffee, more water. I have choices and this lack of detail and service will have me thinking of staying in Del Mar next time I’m out.\n",
      "...because of Neil, Kevin and Raul.  As we all emerge back into restorative or productive shared spaces (vacations, conferences, etc.), there are overwhelming choices and some places have fared better than others.  This property is doing something right with their people, because the people here are making this experience right.  Neil at the front desk went way above and beyond to ensure our stay was exemplary, taking the time to listen to my husband and respond with compassion and genuine collaboration to create joy.  That sounds overblown.  It's not.  Neil did a lovely service to our family.  Kevin in guest services also came alongside as we struggled a bit to resolve a logistical tangle and just seemed genuinely pleased to help.     Raul at the Torreyana Grill (in the hotel)\n",
      "We had dinner at Torreyana. Mary Jane our server was great.  She was cheerful, made sure our orders were correct before submitting them, and checked up on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.\n",
      "The Hilton is located in a prime area  just outside the city overlooking the Torrey Pines golf course and close to the beach. Special thanks to Maria at the check in counter for choosing a great room and to Raul for the great customer service and remembering my order every day. Also, an excellent staff makes you want to come back for more..\n",
      "I stayed at this property as it was close to the area where I had business. The hotel is very nice, has great golf-course, ocean and sunset views, and a great wait staff. The bartenders are very personable and attentive as well.   The hotel rates were reasonable, particularly considering the location and quality of accommodations. Beware of hidden fees above and beyond the hotel rate though. There are several taxes and odd \"tourism fees\" (not the fault of Hilton) but also an outrageous daily parking fee. I would assume parking would be somewhat subsidzied by those paying for a room (where that might not be the case if someone were to park there to golf or attend a conference/event), but added by 4 nights, the parking fee costed almost as much as an additional night in the room.\n",
      "We checked in and my wife refused to stay because the room and facility was so run down.  They refused to refund us for the room or parking. We were only on site a few minutes. What an insult. They say, 'we have a policy that we can't change'.  I would have thought that the Hilton at Torrey Pines would be a legit property. This is a flea bag run by crooks.\n",
      "Customer Service at check-in was lacking. The furniture was threadbare, dilapidated and worn. The room Air Conditioning did not cook adequately. Not what we expected. For the cost and the location we expected something much nicer.\n",
      "Janet Pineda was great.  I can't ask for a better service!  I was there for a business conference.  Her service made the stay experience just much better than other hotels I stayed.  For event organizers, this hotel is a great venue to leave attendees speechless.  Thank you!\n",
      "We come to this hotel once a year and my most favorite person that works there is Rich Woods.  He is the Bell Captain and he is the nicest guy and so helpful.  He makes Torrey Hilton a home away from home.  THANK YOU RICH!  See you next year! Big hugs.  Deena\n",
      "Rich woods is the BEST!!! He’s given us lots of advice/suggestions about what to do in San Diego and it’s all been amazing!!! From La Jolla cove to Ocean Beach to little Italy. Amazing pasta at Monello the best I’ve ever had. Hodads at ocean beach best burger around. Great guy!!!!\n"

The shower pressure was nice and the toiletries smelled good. We were pleased with the continental breakfast, our two kids (6yo and 8yo) were very happy with the breakfast options.  While most other hotels have eliminated housekeeping during your stay, Old Town Inn still offered it daily.  The location was perfect for our needs. It's so funny to find this nice motel in the middle of such an industrial area.  For anyone with kids, this motel is 15 minutes from the Children's Hospital system of Urgent Care and the Children's Hospital emergency department, too. (Yes, we had *that* kind of vacation.)  We would happily stay here, again.\",\n",

The good things about the place were the amazing friendly staff, the well kept garden/pool area, comfortable bed, clean room, good shower. We did not like the location at all and ended up using Ubers to get about. The negatives for us were the strange smell in the room which we thought was dampness as you could not open any windows to air the room, and we felt the breakfast was poor quality. The coffee was not nice. We were also kept awake one night with loud television noise from the room next door until we eventually called reception at 3 am to sort it out.

VERY convenient to go in any direction for all of the fun things to see throughout the many corners of San Diego (including the airport). Kitchenette is well equipped.  Suite offers two rooms, convenient for work. CONS: it\\'s literally on the other side of the tracks, not within the fun, touristy old town area.  It\\'s close enough to walk but it\\'s not a pleasant walk.  The rooms are dark and dated, the water from our sink had a nasty aroma, towels are threadbare, Wifi was spotty.',\n",

Location is great - short walk to everything you need (complimentary bikes for rent as well!) - including morning coffee/breakfast a short walk down the boardwalk. Yoga overlooking the ocean just a short walk away at Law Street Park, easy access to surfing spots, easy access to gyms, dining, & nightlife.

Would not label beachfront since you have to walk down quite a few steps to access the beach sine the hotel is on a cliff overlooking the beach.  Very nice beach.    Cons : front desk rude and not helpful, especially the night crew.  They were just plain rude.  Made the stay uncomfortable.  Rooms dated.  Coffee on site but staff had a hard time figuring out how to make coffee.  Was ok.  Drinks were sweet with little liquor. Food was ok.  Horel ok and staff not so.  I would relate the service to a super 8.  Definitely not worth the money.  If it wasn't on the beach it would be a $100-$200/ night hotel.  Neighborhood is a spring break style.\",\n",

Had a cup coffee maker.  Miny fridge that was very cold. Large bathroom.  Only suggestion would be to update the tub and shower. It does not live up to the hotel. We had room service one night and it was good.  Drinks at pool were also good but expensive.  Crown and coke was $18.  Only had one.  Hotel is near a lot of restaurants. We would stay here again if back I. Pacific Beach.',\n",

Hard-pressed to beat the location (high-traffic boardwalk at your doorstep, the beach mere steps beyond that though you’ll need to traverse a significant staircase to get from boardwalk to beach level—something to consider if dealing with limited mobility). The view is amazing; well worth getting the full- or partial-ocean-view rooms. I’ve stayed all over San Diego (including many times at the Del in Coronado). I really Loved the vibe of this hotel; its cozy atmosphere is a break from the crowds (which are substantial at the Del) and fits perfectly with PB. Will definitely return and like will become my new go-to place to stay when I’m in SD.',\n",

From arrival at the Lobby, the front desk agent made sure I parked where I was allowed to park for the property. Then I was informed at the front desk, that I had to pay for parking ($25.00 a day). For a one-night stay, the stay was approximately $242.00 USD.  The property is considered a 4-star property. However, please be aware, they do NOT have a restaurant or bar, no fitness facilities, no pool, no room service either.

We have stayed here several times before and this was our best visit,  We stayed in a large 2 bedroom and 1 bath unit in the first level right across from the ocean.

We will be back',\n",

The dressers should be secured to the wall, especially with loose glass on top. The management barely cared. Also, some of the rooms are in the building across the street. There is no elevator and they offer no assistance with bags, even up 2 flights of stairs. For the price I really expected better. At least the location is wonderful.',\n",

We thought we had found our place to escape to the quiet, peaceful side of life.   Things declined in the last two visits. The Housekeeping Staff remained very friendly and helpful, but the  Administrative and Management Staff seemed much less friendly and supportive - especially over the New Year\\'s  period.

The day I was leaving, he found out there were chargers at the convention center and road his golf cart in front of me to show me where to go and took me in the cart to the convention center elevators.

We stayed here years ago and my daughter mentioned milk and cookies as we got out of the car.  Ten min later we got to the room and milk and cookies were delivered.  The doorman had overheard the comment and followed through.  That's the type of employees that work here.  I am pleased to say the employees at the hotel still maintain that bar.  They are very hospitable and aware and do what they can.  Unfortunately,  the management of the hotel in general (not calling out the manager, just the general policies, maybe pushed from corporate, I don't know) just makes the experience feel like a money grab.  Let me explain.  First, there is basically one restaurant. Addison\",\n",

       " 'I came for the Mother’s Day tea and it was the worst experience I have ever had. The food was horrible, you could tell that all the pastries were stale and made before hand. Everything was either too dry and bland or too sugary and rich. They needed a better balance of food to create a food journey (what I would expect for the price). The servers didn’t know what they were giving us and two times, I was given fish eggs even though I ordered vegetarian foods. The location of the tea was in a huge room with horrible acoustics, you could hear everyone talking because the space made the volume magnified which also caused you to hear every dish clink, stack and break. Terrible from start to finish.',\n",

Highly recommend!!',\n",

The MRKT was a great place to get breakfast each morning and we had an absolute wonderful time at ARLO. John at ARLO was very accommodating with our son and made the experience very memorable. My family will definitely be back to visit and I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a great place for a family vacation.',\n",

From the Front Desk staff who greeted us warmly, to the overall ambiance of the hotel, and to the many amenities and activities the hotel had to offer. We enjoyed hanging out around the fire pits as a family. We watched The Sandlot movie at the pool. The rooms were exceptionally clean. The bed was comfortable. Highly recommend visiting their restaurant, Arlo, and try the squid on the menu. I’ve never had squid so tender! Fish and chips at the pool restaurant was so delicious. Resort is conveniently walking distance to Fashion Valley mall. We will definitely come back! Thank you Town & Country!',\n",

I don’t recommend for single women travelers, as it is a garden style hotel. It is a bit on the outskirts of downtown, but does have a mall and the train/buses close by.  It is right by the highway so it got a bit nosey at night, but again, it’s ok for short stays.  The food (breakfast) was pretty good as well.  The spa looks really nice, although I didn’t try it.  At the time, the rental car office was close but expected to possibly resume late 2023.',\n",

No email was ever received. Finally checked back at 4pm to be told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Rooms are old and dated. The a/c was inoperable, as was the phone in the room.

I requested new sheets 3 times during our stay and never got a fitted sheet.',\n",

It has a heated pool, very comfortable beds and is superclean. It may not look as modern as other motels in this area, but has virtually the same on offer for a much lower rate. Only downside is that the Hotel Circle area is not very attractive. It has a lot of hotels but no restaurants, bars or even a convenience store like 7 Eleven. Also the Handlery does not offer lunch, which means that at lunchtime you’re on your own (getting crisps from the vending machine is the only option really). Breakfast service may be a bit chaotic at times but the food on offer is good. Bar prices are reasonable but the bar closes early, on some days even at 9PM. So',\n",

The fist thing that jumps out at us was the interesting setup of several low-rise buildings surrounding a pretty lush and pleasant center courtyard where the pool, jacuzzi and a fish pond are located.  in terms of facility, our kids enjoyed the outdoor (but heated) pool and there is well-stocked fitness center.

When we checked in, we had been upgraded to a larger room, which had a seating area with a couch and table, a large bed,  and a decent sized bathroom.  Bed was comfortable ans the room was clean.

Our room was the furthest - had to walk down 2 long paths  (past the pool) then swipe hotel key card into a building, then take an elevator to our floor, then walk through doors to a few outdoor rooms to reach ours. It took a few minutes just to get to our room. These open paths are a security issue. The paths are open to anyone with no visible security. No walkway signs telling you how to get to the front desk. If any issue should arise, the front desk is a few minutes of a walk from the paths. Definitely was a concern to me walking alone at times. Front desk staff are very nice & helpful.

My building was the farthest from checkin.  If it was raining, you'd need to walk thru other buildings to stay dry.  The building I was in I had to use key to enter the building to use elevator to the 3rd floor.

Got in at 3pm after a long drive, and expected to get my room as check in time is 3 pm . But no - there were none available, and another 20 people ahead of me waiting to get a room.

Kevin in guest services also came alongside as we struggled a bit to resolve a logistical tangle and just seemed genuinely pleased to help.     Raul at the Torreyana Grill (in the hotel)\",\n",
       " 'We had dinner at Torreyana. Mary Jane our server was great.  She was cheerful, made sure our orders were correct before submitting them, and checked up on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.',\n",
       " 'The Hilton is located in a prime area  just outside the city overlooking the Torrey Pines golf course and close to the beach. Special thanks to Maria at the check in counter for choosing a great room and to Raul for the great customer service and remembering my order every day. Also, an excellent staff makes you want to come back for more..',\n",
       " 'I stayed at this property as it was close to the area where I had business. The hotel is very nice, has great golf-course, ocean and sunset views, and a great wait staff. The bartenders are very personable and attentive as well.   The hotel rates were reasonable, particularly considering the location and quality of accommodations. Beware of hidden fees above and beyond the hotel rate though. There are several taxes and odd \"tourism fees\" (not the fault of Hilton) but also an outrageous daily parking fee. I would assume parking would be somewhat subsidzied by those paying for a room (where that might not be the case if someone were to park there to golf or attend a conference/event), but added by 4 nights, the parking fee costed almost as much as an additional night in the room.',\n",
       " \"We checked in and my wife refused to stay because the room and facility was so run down.  They refused to refund us for the room or parking. We were only on site a few minutes. What an insult. They say, 'we have a policy that we can't change'.  I would have thought that the Hilton at Torrey Pines would be a legit property. This is a flea bag run by crooks.\",\n",
       " 'Customer Service at check-in was lacking. The furniture was threadbare, dilapidated and worn. The room Air Conditioning did not cook adequately. Not what we expected. For the cost and the location we expected something much nicer.',\n",
       " \"Janet Pineda was great.  I can't ask for a better service!  I was there for a business conference.  Her service made the stay experience just much better than other hotels I stayed.  For event organizers, this hotel is a great venue to leave attendees speechless.  Thank you!\",\n",
       " 'We come to this hotel once a year and my most favorite person that works there is Rich Woods.  He is the Bell Captain and he is the nicest guy and so helpful.  He makes Torrey Hilton a home away from home.  THANK YOU RICH!  See you next year! Big hugs.  Deena',\n",
       " 'Rich woods is the BEST!!! He’s given us lots of advice/suggestions about what to do in San Diego and it’s all been amazing!!! From La Jolla cove to Ocean Beach to little Italy. Amazing pasta at Monello the best I’ve ever had. Hodads at ocean beach best burger around. Great guy!!!!']"
